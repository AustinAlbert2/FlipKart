1. Camera is 10/10
2. The battery is good as of now, and will improve as it studies usage patterns and makes adjustments in background apps.
3. Design is awesome, the colour is awesome. The body is light weight but strong and durable.
4. 90Hz refresh rate, it doesn't feel like it is lacking 120Hz at all. Its smooth as Cream.
5. There is a little heat issue specially on left edge.
6. Tensor G2 processor, didn't really tried gaming, but multitasking is easy and chill.
7. For charging there is an adaptive mode which slows charging, switched it off and was charging fine, 30 minutes to 50-60% battery.",4

Have used Costar 33w fast charger to charge Pixel7a by 40% in 35 mins. Live Captions on voice call is great feature !!!

Pros:
excelllent build quality.
display is bright enough in full sunlight.
battery drops down to 30% end of the day which is more than enough for a average or higher average user. (AI optimizes battery as per user's usage)
no network issue found yet .. call quality is very good till now as compared to pixel 4a.
phones heats up during first set up but after andriod 14 update no such heavy heating observed.

cons:
thick bezel.
charging is a bit slow.

so all those youtuber's who gave negetive feedback either did not get paid by google or the issues has been fixed by google with OTA updates.",5

Heats a Lot , if you are living in a state with more than 32 degree. dont go for it because it heats a lot

Pros.

Camera
Os
Display
Chip(not for extreme gaming) - optimized with os makes a better user experience. The chip delivers near flagship grade performance. But not the best chip for long gaming sessions

Cons

Charging time is a high

Heating is Normal but some times it heats a little. Maybe it's because of the two x1 chip design and the x1 is an ML powerhouse which is a big part of a Google design",5

First let's talk about problems.
1) Heating little more than other phones in this range.

2) Hanging, I am seeing extreme level of hanging in this phone. Recently I took a screenshot and the phone just hang there and nothing was working, after some try I used voice assistant to power off my device and now it works perfectly normal. I'm afraid this issue can be repeated.

3) network problem, and this one is very common in pixel 7 series phones.

Other than that everything works just fine and I'm happy about it. But Google has failed to solved some basic issues like hanging, network issues and battery life.",3

Its a perfect pocket friendly, premium android smartphone that one can ask for. I got it for 39999 which might not be the final price (as price generally drops for pixel mid range phones in a couple of months). Let me list down pros and cons below:

PROS:
1. The device feels good in ur hand. Its compact, color coding is good, buttons are tactile and the google logo gives it an edge. There is a 'Made in Taiwan' logo also which can be ignored as the font is very small.
2. The software experience of stock Android is simplly superb. It makes u feel easy as there r no unnecessary notifications, ads or apps.
3. The camera is a beast at this price point. The portrait shots are fabulous, low light photos are pretty dynamic yet natural. Image processing takes a tad bit long but produces some amazing shots.
4. Supports all 5g bands. Have tested on Airtel 5G+, and it performed extremely well with download speeds of upto 200 Mbps.
5. The pricing is just about correct for this device if you can get it for 39999. It will be one of the first phones to get Android 14 in which google is planning to do some good things (AI)
6. Face unlock works very good.
7. Multimedia experience is also very good with a vibrant HDR screen and power packed stereo speakers.

CONS:
1. Bezels on the screen make the screen look a bit outdated.
2. It does not come with allways on 90Hz refresh rate for the display. It auto switches between 60 and 90Hz depending on the requirement of the content to be displayed.
3. Battery life is good. Can easily last a day even after heavy usage. But charging at 18 watts is very slow. Can take 3 hrs for a full charge.

Rest assured, the phone looks good. If you have the budget, just go for it. It comes from Google, one of the biggest brands in the world. You won't be disappointed.",4

The speakers quality is top notch too.

1. Heats up a lot. Battery drains too fast.
2. Battery alone makes it a phone that's a pain to live with.
3. Performance is also sub par.
4. You'll need a PD/PPS charger to charge it at an acceptable pace.

Software flaws.
1. Video over LTE calls are not supported. That means no Jio video calls, you'll need to use Meet or other apps to make a video call.
2. Call recording is not supported.

But very much disappointment with battery and charging.

I bought original Google charger with this phone. The battery wasn't charging at all. After research in Google I disabled Adaptive charging. After that it started charging. But dead slow. Took 1 hr from 31 to 50% charge.

Heating issue also there. Heats badly like we can't hold the phone in hand.

This is my 1st day observation. Will update after using for few days..

Edit: 2nd day morning charged faster to 100%

Edit 2: Heating issue reduced after 2nd day of use. The battery was draining too fast. Restricted background activities of many Apps helped to reduce the draining speed.

Pros: Awesome camera quality. Accurate color. Low light. Excellent night shot.

Cons: Battery needs to be charged twice a day.
Cannot set a separate ringtone for dual sim.
Can cast the screen only to Chromecast inbuilt TVs.",3

if u love taking photos and u love stock Android, get it

What has improved:

the pixel 7 is much faster than how generally we expect a pixel phone to be. Usually pixel phones are much slower compared to flagship but this time Google has nailed it with raw performance.

What to hate about it:
1. The 5g modem in this is garbage. I use it with 5g disabled and on LTE. If u don't disable 5g the phone WILL heat up a lot(the phone is continuously searching for 5g network unless it's disabled in settings)

2. Fingerprint scanner is really annoying (seriously Google? This is 2023)

3. Battery is much less if u compare it to older models. This is not a negative but it's because of the newer better performing processor. Actually if u enable battery saver it does save a lot of battery, especially on mobile data. Using the phone under wifi networks have me sufficient charge.",5

Poor battery performance make worst, After full charge (without 5g) and without much use it won't long for day.
Even if you are watching videos or using camera mobile heats a lot. Personally after spending 35k+ not worth it. Regreating to choose pixel.",2

Good phone in 30 k price.
Initial days heating observed for 2 to 3 days , after regular use I have not observed the heating issue.

PROS

Camera : 5/5 Camera is the best. It's better than iPhones. My iPhone user friends are appreciating it's camera. However, I'm yet to test the video. I bought it because of it's Camera and looks.

Design: 5/5 Excellent design and looks. iPhones are very common these days and being owner of this unique phone brings sense of pride. People just love my phone when they see it.


CONS

Battery : 4/5 Battery backup is awesome but not that great. Lasts enough just like iPhones. Charges 60% in just an hour which is great enough for me because I never charge my phone to 100%. I don't understand why people are complaining about it.

Fingerprint: 1/5 Fingerprint doesn't work well after recent updates to Android 14. I hope Google find the fix to this issue soon.

Display : Not that great, I guess. Sometimes touch didn't work properly for me. I don't know if I got defective one.",5

Day to day tasks are very smooth,
Take very good photos. No editing like color enhance or anything is done on the attached photos.
Tried playing BGMI, performance was smooth in game almost constant 60 fps but heats up while gaming so you can't play high end games for long.

I got the update the same day I got my phone so I updated it to Android 14, and all the reviews are based on that experience

Heated when I was setting the phone up, which included transferring of app and data from my old phone to this one and during the first 2 updates.

After that i didn't face any issues with the heating in normal usage, still heats on graphic intensive tasks though, but again almost every phone heats up my old realme heats up too and even iqoo 9 Se of my brother but pixel heats up relatively quickly than iQoo 9Se, hell even iPhone 15 pro Max heats up.

Battery backup was below average on the first two days then it started to improve, Google does some ai magic in the background.

Now it can easily handle a day for medium usage. Today itself the screen on time is around 6 hour 10 minutes and it still had 21 % battery left. It has been around 24 hours since I last charged it. I guess it will give around 1.5 hours more SOT.

On the first day it was around 4.5 hours today it will be 7.5-8 hours of SOT. But today I didn't do any graphic intensive task apart from recording a 1080p 60 fps video for around 30 minutes .

And my screen refresh rate is set to smooth 90hz",5

-such a awesome camera (though with updates it will get even better)

- performance is good ,no jitters and even 60hz feels smooth enough.
- haptics are good üëç
- charging is slow ü¶• but battery last's long so not a big issue.(2HRS WITH NORMAL CHARGER)
- 5G connectivity issues are there as of now, (and heating occurs only while using 5G and maps) 4G works just üëç awesome (these issues should be resolved with temperature going down in India after Summers and with updates too.
- the processor is capable enough to run and multi task heavy apps so no worries on the performance part.
- besides these things there is nothing to worry, everything is üòé Awesome.



Will Update after a month

- Feels like adaptive thing really works great according to the usage, satisfied.
-update like feature drop does'nt releases for every phone at a time, it's in batches.
-heatings get's controlled ig after somedays of usage
-Connectivity usage are resolved for me as of now.

Camera- 9/10 . It captures detailed photos but a dedicated zoom lens is missing so zoomed photos are not clear.

Performance - 10/10. This phone performs great in every day tasks. Multitasking and ram management is great. I don't do heavy gaming but you can play games like pubg and cod with no issues.

Battery -8/10. After tweaking some settings, I get about 6 hours of SOT every day. Battery charging is not too slow but not fast either. I get no heating issues till now.

Design - 10/10. I like it's compact design. It's very easy for one hand use. Phone don't feel too big in pocket. Build quality is also great. Plastic on the back mimic like glass and have good quality.

Display 9/10. Display colours are vibrant. Movies look good in this display. Although it struggles when you use in direct sunlight. Display is not bright enough.",5

display (90hz is good coming from 120hz it's good doesn't feel too much of difference)

corn
slow charging (18watt max).
battery backup is not great but acceptable.
heats the top left aluminium frame. it will get warm on normal day to day tasks, it's bearable (every phone heats that much) but when you run benchmark or do software updates then it gets pretty hot like a lot.
bezels are quite huge
price (if you get around 30k then it's good but 40k is too much )

i have given it 5 stars because i got the device for around 27.5k (including exchange and bank offers), for that price the phone is totally worth it and value for money. if i would have bought the same device for around 40k i would have given it a 3/5 stars.",5

*Camera is fantastic
*Battery will come for one day with the screen time of 5 hrs as per my charge cycle 15 to 95
*If u charge till 0 to 100 it will come easily 6.5 to 7 hrs Max
*If you use with full brightness then ur battery drain easily 20% within a hour for sure
*Display is good
The charging time would be like 1.30hrs for 15 to 95 percent,It may take less than 2 hrs for 0 to 100.

These battery life is only on normal usage like social media, calling,videos and scrolling web pages. I have not play any games in my phone
These are my overall experience about battery
Other than that all other things are good",4

They'll have to bring it down to 28-30k like before.

Heating is still a BIG problem, even at 25C ambient temperature, the phone will start heating while doing the most basic stuff like scrolling through IG, video calling, YouTube/Netflix streaming or simply browsing the web. It really becomes uncomfortable to hold.

The camera is not as good as the Pixel 7, which is expected.

The front camera is very very weak in low light, too much noise reduction in video. Loss of details is evident.

Performance is fine, nothing extraordinary, there are lags and frame drops while multi tasking for swiping through heavy apps. It is irritating given the fact that same chip is used in 7 and 7pro.

The phone is too good, it's so smooth at 90hz and the in hand feel is too premium and also the main thing is it's compact!
Camera- it is literally the best at this price range, I had iPhone 13 previously and this pixel takes much better and original colour photos than that!
Processor - the processor is good for normal use I tried bgmi and took the hot drop then it lagged like crazy but after 1 min it got stable and I was getting 55-60 fps constant at smooth extreme, though it's not a gaming device, it can run games with decent performance.
Battery - The battery is good, it takes approx 1.5 hrs to charge on original Samsung charger, and it drains a little fast while using camera and games but In scrolling, calls, normal tasks it is very great!
Display- The display is good and very responsive and pixel animations are so gorgeous but the full brightness feels low in outside conditions!
So overall I'd give 4.5/5 to this device, also this phone heated a lot while setting up for the first time and when I upgraded it to Android 14 but after that it has never heated a bit except it gets warm while using camera or games for long time!",5

4) Screen/Display is awesome, tried increasing little system font. Letter and images are crisp.
5) Face recognition works only in light, which is utterly poor. So I'm just using touch ID which is just fine and secure.

It's been just one month, I'll update later. I got it in replacement with my 2.5 years old iPhone 11 128 GB. For me it's worth it as the camera and screen are far better than the iPhone 11.

Battery: if you are heavy user probably you will need to change during the day, else will just make it till the end of the day. Also wait for the device to optimise itself in 2-3 days post first time setup.
Charging: this is a bin negative and yes the charging speed is snail pace low...it take literally 2-3 hours to get fully charged.
Overheating: does get warm up during hefty usage otherwise it's fine. Also just to draw a comparison, we are mi and realme people compared to it it's not even warm ü§£
Jokes apart yes it gets warm but upon heavy usage and if you have restricted background apps then that too will get resolved.
Performance: absolute delight all apps and tasks run butter smooth, not a gamer though but played few light games ran fine.
UI experience: flawless...90hz display is not enabled by default but once you enable it...it becomes whole different experience.
Display: display is good quality OLED, no complaints but yes little less Max brightness so direct under the sun visibility is good not great.

Finally: would recommend it as it's a great phone and ticks most of the qualities one looks for in a device. Only problem I see is the battery, if your usage is high then this is not the device for you. As battery won't last long and you will stay plugged for a very long time to add some.",5

Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons.
Pro:
1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation.
2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates.
3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email.
4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone.
Cons:
1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow.
2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well.
3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find.
4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes.
Update after 1 month:
1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging.
2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure.
3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone.
Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.",5

If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price.
Pros:-

Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.

Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates

Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone

Cons:-

Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.

Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.",4

The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples.
The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures.
The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem.
AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better.
So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.


HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day.
The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable.
The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.

I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.

All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations",4

- Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!!
- 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics.
- Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight.
- Slick haptics
- Battery lasts an entire day
- Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS.
- Superb value if bought during the sale.

What you may not:
- It's a portable hand warmer. 8)
- Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery.
- Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!)
- SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM
- Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).

I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.

I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.

Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.",5

But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.

Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.

Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.

When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.

- PROS
- Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter.
- Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural
- Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer.
- Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot.
- Battery is decent

Cons
- As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once.

Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product",5

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.

The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.

Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)",5

AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.

Cons:
Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.

Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.

Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100.

But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons.
Pro:
1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation.
2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates.
3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email.
4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone.
Cons:
1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow.
2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well.
3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find.
4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes.
Update after 1 month:
1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging.
2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure.
3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone.
Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.",5

If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price.
Pros:-

Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.

Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates

Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone

Cons:-

Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.

Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.",4

The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples.
The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures.
The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem.
AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better.
So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.


HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day.
The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable.
The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.

I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.

All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations",4

- Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!!
- 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics.
- Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight.
- Slick haptics
- Battery lasts an entire day
- Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS.
- Superb value if bought during the sale.

What you may not:
- It's a portable hand warmer. 8)
- Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery.
- Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!)
- SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM
- Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).

I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.

I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.

Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.",5

After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

1. Performance - Great
2. Camera - definitely better than apple in colour quality but have to improve in blur and potrait mode
3. Battery - after 90% charge it will give you 1 day battery life easily
4. Design - The Best in world
5. Display - it's too good

Bonus point (TiP)
Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.

Please don't go for ambrane charger
Will regret like me and ambrane charger don't even give refund.",3

Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.

Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.

When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.

- PROS
- Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter.
- Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural
- Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer.
- Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot.
- Battery is decent

Cons
- As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once.

Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product",5

3)save passwords error as instead of login Id it shows password

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.

The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.

Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)",5

Design: its size is compact and great for single hand usage and it's design is unique. Haptic and vibration is so good .

AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.

Cons:
Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.

Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.

Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100.

But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons.
Pro:
1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation.
2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates.
3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email.
4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone.
Cons:
1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow.
2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well.
3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find.
4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes.
Update after 1 month:
1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging.
2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure.
3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone.
Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.",5

If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price.
Pros:-

Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.

Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates

Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone

Cons:-

Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.

Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.",4

The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples.
The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures.
The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem.
AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better.
So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.


HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day.
The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable.
The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.

I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.

All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations",4

- Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight.
- Slick haptics
- Battery lasts an entire day
- Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS.
- Superb value if bought during the sale.

What you may not:
- It's a portable hand warmer. 8)
- Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery.
- Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!)
- SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM
- Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).

Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.

I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.

Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.",5

But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

Go for only Google charger, I bought ambrane charger which said it's 30W but written doun if can only give Power supply Max of 20v so go for only Google charger.

Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.

Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.

When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.

- PROS
- Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter.
- Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural
- Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer.
- Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot.
- Battery is decent

Cons
- As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once.

Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product",5

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.

The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.

Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)",5

AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.

Cons:
Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.

Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.

Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons.
Pro:
1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation.
2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If you find bugs just report it and they will sort out in like a week by OTA updates.
3. Battery: There's a catch here. Just use it for like a week in the beginning. It will be very bad but after a week I don't know what happened it just gives me like a day and half battery easily with around 6-7 hours of screen on time any day. I'm a moderate user, just use it for music, social media, camera and email.
4. Looks: It is easily distinguished by others, that it is a pixel phone. It looks different, feels great in hand, is a one hand phone.
Cons:
1. Charging: I'm using the google 30W charger and it takes around 1 and half hour to charge from like 5-10% to 100. It initially charges fast but after around 70 becomes very slow.
2. Heat: If you're on 5G network and downloading stuff, it tends to heat up but not uncomfortably hot. Same goes for gaming as well.
3. Accessories: They are hard to find in market. Provided by companies like Spigen and google are quite expensive. Screen guard is a hard match to find.
4. Network: Not much of a issue for me. I've using a Vi and an airtel sim in it. All I can say is there is a slight network reception lower than other phones but doesn't affect the calling per say. Yes it do affect downloading speeds sometimes.
Update after 1 month:
1. Heating issues: Its resolved quite a lot. I hardly find the phone to be heating while using or while charging.
2. Screen: I recently noticed that it has a very bright screen and has excellent outdoor visibility. It much brighter than iphones for sure.
3.AI features: I've not used like every AI features but I've used magic eraser and it works very good. Feels as if it was photoshopped by someone.
Even used it with videos. It erases the background noises very professionally.",5

If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price.
Pros:-

Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you will be spending quite some time fidgeting with the gazillion AI features this phone comes with.

Software: another highlight of this phone, fluid software, no bloatware nothing, just the pure Android experience. Although there are some bugs right now, like screen freezing etc, but they will surely be solved by further software updates

Display and design: Display is crisp and sharp and the design of the phone gives the user a comfortable holding experience. One handed usable phone

Cons:-

Network connectivity: downright bad, I continuously shift between 3 states and in places where my s20 gives pretty good connections, the pixel fails. Can't even make calls or do UPI transactions in some places. In my opinion, places where the network signals are good this phone can do well as soon as the amount of signals drop the phone struggles to capture signals. Keep this in mind before buying this phone a real headache for me.

Performance: As I am not a heavy gamer, I can't say anything on the gaming front but I did run some rendering tasks and the phone heated up like crazy. But to the avg user this phone has enough power to pull itself through the day. BATTERY is average tho.",4

The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples.
The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures.
The display is amazing, the UI is smooth and has that premium feel because of the small details (animations, etc) that google pays attention to. The speakers are loud and good. However, the pitch seems to go a little higher than the original audio at maximum volume - it's noticeable only if you listen closely though. Not that big of a problem.
AI features - best-take, magic eraser, etc work well enough. Once gemini nano comes to this phone, let's see how things get better.
So many customisation options on the pure Android make the phone feel like a delight.


HOWEVER, there are a few drawbacks. The battery life is not all that great - it does last me a full day but I'm only a moderate user. Anything more and I need to recharge it atleast once during the day.
The charging is slow. I moved from a POCO 67 watt ultra charge speed and this feels awfully slow compared to that, even with Google's official charger and cable.
The phone does heat up - it's not THAT bad that you cannot hold it in your hands. It's as heated as a mid+range phone doing high-range tasks. However it is disappointing to see this heating issue on a premium device that we pay so much for. The phone heats up especially while running on mobile data/ with hotspot turned on. Even when idle, it's warm. Warm. not hot to be really honest.

I have not found Any other common issues reported with pixel 8 - such h as face unlock being slow, or fingerprint reader being bad and slow, or network coverage issues (in fact, network coverage is better than my old phone - I get data in places I did not previously receive). Performance with games (I don't play extremely heavy games - just 400-600 MB type of games) is also good and smooth. No issues there either.

All in all, except the occasional warming up and slight battery issue (draining and charging both), the phone is a must buy. Everything else about it is literally perfect - especially the satisfying haptics and the countless customisations",4

- Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!!
- 'Best take' feature is a must have. Boon if you have kids or take a lot of group pics.
- Compact, Fast and Great Screen... easily visible even in direct sunlight.
- Slick haptics
- Battery lasts an entire day
- Smartness just evenly spread across the entire OS.
- Superb value if bought during the sale.

What you may not:
- It's a portable hand warmer. 8)
- Slightly heavy vs the competition due to the battery.
- Casting only works to Chromecast and Android TVs. (Hdmi out via USB-C does save the day!)
- SIM+eSIM instead of dual SIM
- Not-so-fast Fast charging. 1.5h to full. Also no battery life extender (like 80% limit).

I chose this over the iPhone 15 and S24 and my oh my I was right. There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.

I have loved the experience of the product so far and I am glad I bought the Pixel 8. However, there are still some points to note. The camera doesn't have a Pro mode or High Res mode, although there is RAW mode and you can use Pro mode in Lightroom Camera. The first few days with the battery and charging are a pain. The adaptive battery kicks after quite a long time. The features are available but you need to leave the product on WiFi and charge all night for it to fully set up.

Also, the Pixel 8 is a goddamn heater when using 5G that's the only thing I don't like. I know it's because of the Samsung 5G modem they use but 5G takes away all the battery and heats up the phone really badly. So beware.",5

I was a fan since Nexus series but now with the Pixel series specifically Pixel 8 they did a major upgrade complementing with AI and photography. Google has always been champ of OS and now they are excelling Hardware also combining AI and Photography. Cheers.,5

But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

Having said that, the phone is really good to use in hands the haptics, screen, buttons everything u interact with is a really good experience.

Camera for which this phone is praised is also really good. But, in back camera switching to .5 zoom and taking pic of anything closer yields a very pixelated image. Also, if u open the camera all the other apps are just abruptly killed. Yes that 8GB ain't enough to keep the apps open in the background. We gotta rely on the app itself to resume from where we left.

When it comes to usage sadly the battery life is horrible for the 80+k i paid I would expect atleast 5 to 6 hrs of SOT. But all I get is 3 - 4 hrs that with few tweaks done here and there.

- PROS
- Clean Android experience pure stock, no lags no jitter.
- Camera quality is superb , no over saturation of colors like other brands, It's impossible to take the wrong photo with Pixel. Picture quality is also near natural
- Processing speed is okay for my work as I am not a heavy user or gamer.
- Heating is there when you use the phone constantly but it's bearable and normal , it does not get sky high hot.
- Battery is decent

Cons
- As such no cons but I observed one unintended restart while recording a video. Happened only once.

Will update the review on a longer run. 34k in the big billion days is worth for the product",5

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

This is the phone I would like to keep for at least 4 years. The phone is of perfect size, one of the best display panels I've seen on phones. Battery backup is top notch, they've definitely improved the speaker with this one. The OS is buttery smooth. They fixed the biometric scanner issue, now we have both face recognition and finger print working better than pixel 7 series.

The only area I didn't find any upgrade is the camera, I compared both the phones side by side. In some cases I liked pictures taken in my old pixel 7.

Go for it if you want to use it for a long time. Price should've been a little less at least by 8 to 10k. (I got it for a good deal, so I'm not complaining)",5

AI features: there are lots of AI and other features that makes this phone brilliant than other phones.

Cons:
Battery: battery consumption improved a lot from day 1 but still it can't make it more than a day even with minimum usage. When using mobile data battery draining is more than using wifi. Charging takes 1.5 hours max . Those who are complaining slow charging disable adaptive charging option.

Heating: phone warms with normal usage too. But it heats up a lot in direct sunlight.

Others: no applock inbuilt. No Lock screen widget.

I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks and I will say I am totally impressed by what you get on the phone.
If google stands by its claim of 7 years of OS update, then there are no regrets but only time will tell.

Pros:
1. Performance is smooth. It is not a flagship killer or an ultimate gaming phone but you will be plesently surprised by what it can offer. I haven't witnessed any glitches or lag as such so far. All app use experience has been top notch. But if you are looking for a gaming phone then look elsewhere.
2. Very clicky buttons and ultimate haptic feedback. This probably even beats the Iphone in this department.
3. Wonderfully designed and the form factor is perfect for one hand use.
4. Battery life has improved quite a bit. It took around 2 weeks for adaptive battery to kick in and ever since it has been amazing. Around 7 hrs of SOT with average to heavy use and still have 25% left at the end of the day. Lets see how it holds up in the long term. Overall very nice!!
5. The cameras and Google's post processing on its images will make you the star of any party. You get true to life colors and the dynamic range is balanced. The HDR mode is very good. And the portraits are also coming out good. I loved the super steady mode on the video camera which works like a charm, but it crops out a bit of the frame. Night mode also is very good, preserves enough detail and is better than what you get from other phone in this price range.
6. The screen is bright and vibrant, very much readable when in direct sunlight.
7. I did almost 40 mins of photo and video shooting but the phone didn't heat up much.

Cons:
1. Me coming from galaxy note 10, still feel that google can add a lot more of software customisations.
2. The finger print sensor is average. Face unlock is a hit and miss, doesn't work in low-light conditions.
3. Speakers could have been better.
4. Doesn't work with Airtel 5G yet. But it may be Airtel's fault they haven't listed the new pixels in there 5G section as of this writing.
5. Price is too high, should have been around 55k. Not sure what Google was thinking about that.

Overall a very well executed phone by Google but the price can be a bummer for many. I would say wait for a couple of months and then you should get very good discounts on this as usual with Google phones.",5

Now, Some cons, This phone has different kind of bugs, felt using in just 8 hrs. I think updates will fixed this later. And guys When u buy a pixel device always buy a Google 30W charger along with this. Coz, I'm charging with my apple 20W Power adapter, It takes like 1.5 hrs to charge 10- 100.

But somehow have not heard great things about One Plus lately, so stuck to top 3. Of that, I wanted to stick to Android as Apple is needlessly exclusive. So ended up with Samsung and Pixel shortlist. After reading multiple reviews, went for Pixel 8. It's a pleasant experience so far. Amaze camera and Ai features, handy compact phone, google keeps doing some nudges and fun stuff on it's own like creating collages, giving some important info like need to clean lens of camera etc. The only reason why I gave it 4 star is that battery lasts just about 18 -20 hours with decent leaning towards heavy usage. Being a one plus user, this was like.. okay. Otherwise go for it. Quite a cool phone. And don't forget to buy fast charger because else its a little primitive in that area.",4

1. Camera is 10/10
2. The battery is good as of now, and will improve as it studies usage patterns and makes adjustments in background apps.
3. Design is awesome, the colour is awesome. The body is light weight but strong and durable.
4. 90Hz refresh rate, it doesn't feel like it is lacking 120Hz at all. Its smooth as Cream.
5. There is a little heat issue specially on left edge.
6. Tensor G2 processor, didn't really tried gaming, but multitasking is easy and chill.

Pros:
excelllent build quality.
display is bright enough in full sunlight.
battery drops down to 30% end of the day which is more than enough for a average or higher average user. (AI optimizes battery as per user's usage)
no network issue found yet .. call quality is very good till now as compared to pixel 4a.
phones heats up during first set up but after andriod 14 update no such heavy heating observed.

cons:
thick bezel.
charging is a bit slow.

Cons

Charging time is a high

Heating is Normal but some times it heats a little. Maybe it's because of the two x1 chip design and the x1 is an ML powerhouse which is a big part of a Google design",5

1) Heating little more than other phones in this range.

2) Hanging, I am seeing extreme level of hanging in this phone. Recently I took a screenshot and the phone just hang there and nothing was working, after some try I used voice assistant to power off my device and now it works perfectly normal. I'm afraid this issue can be repeated.

3) network problem, and this one is very common in pixel 7 series phones.

Its a perfect pocket friendly, premium android smartphone that one can ask for. I got it for 39999 which might not be the final price (as price generally drops for pixel mid range phones in a couple of months). Let me list down pros and cons below:

PROS:
1. The device feels good in ur hand. Its compact, color coding is good, buttons are tactile and the google logo gives it an edge. There is a 'Made in Taiwan' logo also which can be ignored as the font is very small.
2. The software experience of stock Android is simplly superb. It makes u feel easy as there r no unnecessary notifications, ads or apps.
3. The camera is a beast at this price point. The portrait shots are fabulous, low light photos are pretty dynamic yet natural. Image processing takes a tad bit long but produces some amazing shots.
4. Supports all 5g bands. Have tested on Airtel 5G+, and it performed extremely well with download speeds of upto 200 Mbps.
5. The pricing is just about correct for this device if you can get it for 39999. It will be one of the first phones to get Android 14 in which google is planning to do some good things (AI)
6. Face unlock works very good.
7. Multimedia experience is also very good with a vibrant HDR screen and power packed stereo speakers.

CONS:
1. Bezels on the screen make the screen look a bit outdated.
2. It does not come with allways on 90Hz refresh rate for the display. It auto switches between 60 and 90Hz depending on the requirement of the content to be displayed.
3. Battery life is good. Can easily last a day even after heavy usage. But charging at 18 watts is very slow. Can take 3 hrs for a full charge.

Rest assured, the phone looks good. If you have the budget, just go for it. It comes from Google, one of the biggest brands in the world. You won't be disappointed.",4

Charging is slow but as we know iphones are also not providing much faster charging (for its long life and good battery health).
Battery optimization is good. It drains slowly as compared with other devices. The heating issue is there but it doesn't affect its battery.
It's not a GAMING PHONE so don't compare it with SD gen1/2. (However my ANTUTU Score is 795666 in 28 degree room temperature)
Overall performance is great but AI features are making it unique. In this price you cannot get these features but Google made it possible.

Out of 5
Design - 5
(Metal frame and premium quality plastic back makes it more durable)
Display - 4.5 (size - 4, response/appearance - 5)
Camera - 5 (night mode is not that good but other features are best)
Software - 5 (undoubtedly)
Performance - 4 (equivalent to almost SD 888)
Battery - 5
Charging - 3.5
Value for money - 5

It's not for Gamers but best for others. Tech people will love it. Hidden features are also there which you will get to know while using it regularly.

Camera and haptic feedback is awesome, other than everything else is a let down.

First hardware flaws.
1. Heats up a lot. Battery drains too fast.
2. Battery alone makes it a phone that's a pain to live with.
3. Performance is also sub par.
4. You'll need a PD/PPS charger to charge it at an acceptable pace.

Software flaws.
1. Video over LTE calls are not supported. That means no Jio video calls, you'll need to use Meet or other apps to make a video call.
2. Call recording is not supported.
3. Switching mobile-data sim is a hassle. You'll need to dive deep into the settings to do that.

Other than all this, phone is ok. But really not worth the price it asks.",3

But very much disappointment with battery and charging.

I bought original Google charger with this phone. The battery wasn't charging at all. After research in Google I disabled Adaptive charging. After that it started charging. But dead slow. Took 1 hr from 31 to 50% charge.

Heating issue also there. Heats badly like we can't hold the phone in hand.

This is my 1st day observation. Will update after using for few days..

Edit: 2nd day morning charged faster to 100%

Edit 2: Heating issue reduced after 2nd day of use. The battery was draining too fast. Restricted background activities of many Apps helped to reduce the draining speed.

Pros: Awesome camera quality. Accurate color. Low light. Excellent night shot.

Cons: Battery needs to be charged twice a day.
Cannot set a separate ringtone for dual sim.
Can cast the screen only to Chromecast inbuilt TVs.",3

the pixel 7 is much faster than how generally we expect a pixel phone to be. Usually pixel phones are much slower compared to flagship but this time Google has nailed it with raw performance.

What to hate about it:
1. The 5g modem in this is garbage. I use it with 5g disabled and on LTE. If u don't disable 5g the phone WILL heat up a lot(the phone is continuously searching for 5g network unless it's disabled in settings)

2. Fingerprint scanner is really annoying (seriously Google? This is 2023)

3. Battery is much less if u compare it to older models. This is not a negative but it's because of the newer better performing processor. Actually if u enable battery saver it does save a lot of battery, especially on mobile data. Using the phone under wifi networks have me sufficient charge.",5

Earlier I was using Redme Note 8 pro so I was expecting better than it but pixel disappointed.

The only good thing is it's built quality and tear camera is average but night mode is really good.

UI is basic you won't like if u come from xiomi. Touch is average sometimes hard to clicks.
Poor battery performance make worst, After full charge (without 5g) and without much use it won't long for day.
Even if you are watching videos or using camera mobile heats a lot. Personally after spending 35k+ not worth it. Regreating to choose pixel.",2

PROS

Camera : 5/5 Camera is the best. It's better than iPhones. My iPhone user friends are appreciating it's camera. However, I'm yet to test the video. I bought it because of it's Camera and looks.

Design: 5/5 Excellent design and looks. iPhones are very common these days and being owner of this unique phone brings sense of pride. People just love my phone when they see it.


CONS

Battery : 4/5 Battery backup is awesome but not that great. Lasts enough just like iPhones. Charges 60% in just an hour which is great enough for me because I never charge my phone to 100%. I don't understand why people are complaining about it.

Fingerprint: 1/5 Fingerprint doesn't work well after recent updates to Android 14. I hope Google find the fix to this issue soon.

Display : Not that great, I guess. Sometimes touch didn't work properly for me. I don't know if I got defective one.",5

Day to day tasks are very smooth,
Take very good photos. No editing like color enhance or anything is done on the attached photos.
Tried playing BGMI, performance was smooth in game almost constant 60 fps but heats up while gaming so you can't play high end games for long.

I got the update the same day I got my phone so I updated it to Android 14, and all the reviews are based on that experience

Heated when I was setting the phone up, which included transferring of app and data from my old phone to this one and during the first 2 updates.

After that i didn't face any issues with the heating in normal usage, still heats on graphic intensive tasks though, but again almost every phone heats up my old realme heats up too and even iqoo 9 Se of my brother but pixel heats up relatively quickly than iQoo 9Se, hell even iPhone 15 pro Max heats up.

Battery backup was below average on the first two days then it started to improve, Google does some ai magic in the background.

Now it can easily handle a day for medium usage. Today itself the screen on time is around 6 hour 10 minutes and it still had 21 % battery left. It has been around 24 hours since I last charged it. I guess it will give around 1.5 hours more SOT.

On the first day it was around 4.5 hours today it will be 7.5-8 hours of SOT. But today I didn't do any graphic intensive task apart from recording a 1080p 60 fps video for around 30 minutes .

And my screen refresh rate is set to smooth 90hz",5

- performance is good ,no jitters and even 60hz feels smooth enough.
- haptics are good üëç
- charging is slow ü¶• but battery last's long so not a big issue.(2HRS WITH NORMAL CHARGER)
- 5G connectivity issues are there as of now, (and heating occurs only while using 5G and maps) 4G works just üëç awesome (these issues should be resolved with temperature going down in India after Summers and with updates too.
- the processor is capable enough to run and multi task heavy apps so no worries on the performance part.
- besides these things there is nothing to worry, everything is üòé Awesome.



Will Update after a month

- Feels like adaptive thing really works great according to the usage, satisfied.
-update like feature drop does'nt releases for every phone at a time, it's in batches.
-heatings get's controlled ig after somedays of usage
-Connectivity usage are resolved for me as of now.

Camera- 9/10 . It captures detailed photos but a dedicated zoom lens is missing so zoomed photos are not clear.

Performance - 10/10. This phone performs great in every day tasks. Multitasking and ram management is great. I don't do heavy gaming but you can play games like pubg and cod with no issues.

Battery -8/10. After tweaking some settings, I get about 6 hours of SOT every day. Battery charging is not too slow but not fast either. I get no heating issues till now.

Design - 10/10. I like it's compact design. It's very easy for one hand use. Phone don't feel too big in pocket. Build quality is also great. Plastic on the back mimic like glass and have good quality.

Display 9/10. Display colours are vibrant. Movies look good in this display. Although it struggles when you use in direct sunlight. Display is not bright enough.",5

camera

software support
display (90hz is good coming from 120hz it's good doesn't feel too much of difference)

corn
slow charging (18watt max).
battery backup is not great but acceptable.
heats the top left aluminium frame. it will get warm on normal day to day tasks, it's bearable (every phone heats that much) but when you run benchmark or do software updates then it gets pretty hot like a lot.
bezels are quite huge
price (if you get around 30k then it's good but 40k is too much )

i have given it 5 stars because i got the device for around 27.5k (including exchange and bank offers), for that price the phone is totally worth it and value for money. if i would have bought the same device for around 40k i would have given it a 3/5 stars.",5

*Camera is fantastic
*Battery will come for one day with the screen time of 5 hrs as per my charge cycle 15 to 95
*If u charge till 0 to 100 it will come easily 6.5 to 7 hrs Max
*If you use with full brightness then ur battery drain easily 20% within a hour for sure
*Display is good
The charging time would be like 1.30hrs for 15 to 95 percent,It may take less than 2 hrs for 0 to 100.

These battery life is only on normal usage like social media, calling,videos and scrolling web pages. I have not play any games in my phone

Pros -
1. Good design - May not be made of premium material but doesn't feel cheap at all.
2. Great OLED screen with 90 Hz refresh rate
3. Great camera - No description needed
4. Welcome wireless charging - in primitive stage though
5. Great software user experience

Heating is still a BIG problem, even at 25C ambient temperature, the phone will start heating while doing the most basic stuff like scrolling through IG, video calling, YouTube/Netflix streaming or simply browsing the web. It really becomes uncomfortable to hold.

The camera is not as good as the Pixel 7, which is expected.

The front camera is very very weak in low light, too much noise reduction in video. Loss of details is evident.

Performance is fine, nothing extraordinary, there are lags and frame drops while multi tasking for swiping through heavy apps. It is irritating given the fact that same chip is used in 7 and 7pro.

The phone is too good, it's so smooth at 90hz and the in hand feel is too premium and also the main thing is it's compact!
Camera- it is literally the best at this price range, I had iPhone 13 previously and this pixel takes much better and original colour photos than that!
Processor - the processor is good for normal use I tried bgmi and took the hot drop then it lagged like crazy but after 1 min it got stable and I was getting 55-60 fps constant at smooth extreme, though it's not a gaming device, it can run games with decent performance.
Battery - The battery is good, it takes approx 1.5 hrs to charge on original Samsung charger, and it drains a little fast while using camera and games but In scrolling, calls, normal tasks it is very great!
Display- The display is good and very responsive and pixel animations are so gorgeous but the full brightness feels low in outside conditions!
So overall I'd give 4.5/5 to this device, also this phone heated a lot while setting up for the first time and when I upgraded it to Android 14 but after that it has never heated a bit except it gets warm while using camera or games for long time!",5

4) Screen/Display is awesome, tried increasing little system font. Letter and images are crisp.
5) Face recognition works only in light, which is utterly poor. So I'm just using touch ID which is just fine and secure.

It's been just one month, I'll update later. I got it in replacement with my 2.5 years old iPhone 11 128 GB. For me it's worth it as the camera and screen are far better than the iPhone 11.

Battery: if you are heavy user probably you will need to change during the day, else will just make it till the end of the day. Also wait for the device to optimise itself in 2-3 days post first time setup.
Charging: this is a bin negative and yes the charging speed is snail pace low...it take literally 2-3 hours to get fully charged.
Overheating: does get warm up during hefty usage otherwise it's fine. Also just to draw a comparison, we are mi and realme people compared to it it's not even warm ü§£
Jokes apart yes it gets warm but upon heavy usage and if you have restricted background apps then that too will get resolved.
Performance: absolute delight all apps and tasks run butter smooth, not a gamer though but played few light games ran fine.
UI experience: flawless...90hz display is not enabled by default but once you enable it...it becomes whole different experience.
Display: display is good quality OLED, no complaints but yes little less Max brightness so direct under the sun visibility is good not great.

Finally: would recommend it as it's a great phone and ticks most of the qualities one looks for in a device. Only problem I see is the battery, if your usage is high then this is not the device for you. As battery won't last long and you will stay plugged for a very long time to add some.",5

3. Design is awesome, the colour is awesome. The body is light weight but strong and durable.
4. 90Hz refresh rate, it doesn't feel like it is lacking 120Hz at all. Its smooth as Cream.
5. There is a little heat issue specially on left edge.

Pros:
excelllent build quality.
display is bright enough in full sunlight.
battery drops down to 30% end of the day which is more than enough for a average or higher average user. (AI optimizes battery as per user's usage)
no network issue found yet .. call quality is very good till now as compared to pixel 4a.
phones heats up during first set up but after andriod 14 update no such heavy heating observed.

cons:
thick bezel.
charging is a bit slow.

so all those youtuber's who gave negetive feedback either did not get paid by google or the issues has been fixed by google with OTA updates.",5

First let's talk about problems.
1) Heating little more than other phones in this range.

2) Hanging, I am seeing extreme level of hanging in this phone. Recently I took a screenshot and the phone just hang there and nothing was working, after some try I used voice assistant to power off my device and now it works perfectly normal. I'm afraid this issue can be repeated.

3) network problem, and this one is very common in pixel 7 series phones.

Other than that everything works just fine and I'm happy about it. But Google has failed to solved some basic issues like hanging, network issues and battery life.",3

Its a perfect pocket friendly, premium android smartphone that one can ask for. I got it for 39999 which might not be the final price (as price generally drops for pixel mid range phones in a couple of months). Let me list down pros and cons below:

PROS:
1. The device feels good in ur hand. Its compact, color coding is good, buttons are tactile and the google logo gives it an edge. There is a 'Made in Taiwan' logo also which can be ignored as the font is very small.
2. The software experience of stock Android is simplly superb. It makes u feel easy as there r no unnecessary notifications, ads or apps.
3. The camera is a beast at this price point. The portrait shots are fabulous, low light photos are pretty dynamic yet natural. Image processing takes a tad bit long but produces some amazing shots.
4. Supports all 5g bands. Have tested on Airtel 5G+, and it performed extremely well with download speeds of upto 200 Mbps.
5. The pricing is just about correct for this device if you can get it for 39999. It will be one of the first phones to get Android 14 in which google is planning to do some good things (AI)
6. Face unlock works very good.
7. Multimedia experience is also very good with a vibrant HDR screen and power packed stereo speakers.

CONS:
1. Bezels on the screen make the screen look a bit outdated.
2. It does not come with allways on 90Hz refresh rate for the display. It auto switches between 60 and 90Hz depending on the requirement of the content to be displayed.
3. Battery life is good. Can easily last a day even after heavy usage. But charging at 18 watts is very slow. Can take 3 hrs for a full charge.

Rest assured, the phone looks good. If you have the budget, just go for it. It comes from Google, one of the biggest brands in the world. You won't be disappointed.",4

Charging is slow but as we know iphones are also not providing much faster charging (for its long life and good battery health).
Battery optimization is good. It drains slowly as compared with other devices. The heating issue is there but it doesn't affect its battery.
It's not a GAMING PHONE so don't compare it with SD gen1/2. (However my ANTUTU Score is 795666 in 28 degree room temperature)
Overall performance is great but AI features are making it unique. In this price you cannot get these features but Google made it possible.

(Metal frame and premium quality plastic back makes it more durable)
Display - 4.5 (size - 4, response/appearance - 5)

First hardware flaws.
1. Heats up a lot. Battery drains too fast.
2. Battery alone makes it a phone that's a pain to live with.
3. Performance is also sub par.
4. You'll need a PD/PPS charger to charge it at an acceptable pace.

Software flaws.
1. Video over LTE calls are not supported. That means no Jio video calls, you'll need to use Meet or other apps to make a video call.
2. Call recording is not supported.

But very much disappointment with battery and charging.

I bought original Google charger with this phone. The battery wasn't charging at all. After research in Google I disabled Adaptive charging. After that it started charging. But dead slow. Took 1 hr from 31 to 50% charge.

Heating issue also there. Heats badly like we can't hold the phone in hand.

This is my 1st day observation. Will update after using for few days..

Edit: 2nd day morning charged faster to 100%

Edit 2: Heating issue reduced after 2nd day of use. The battery was draining too fast. Restricted background activities of many Apps helped to reduce the draining speed.

Pros: Awesome camera quality. Accurate color. Low light. Excellent night shot.

Cons: Battery needs to be charged twice a day.
Cannot set a separate ringtone for dual sim.
Can cast the screen only to Chromecast inbuilt TVs.",3

the pixel 7 is much faster than how generally we expect a pixel phone to be. Usually pixel phones are much slower compared to flagship but this time Google has nailed it with raw performance.

What to hate about it:
1. The 5g modem in this is garbage. I use it with 5g disabled and on LTE. If u don't disable 5g the phone WILL heat up a lot(the phone is continuously searching for 5g network unless it's disabled in settings)

2. Fingerprint scanner is really annoying (seriously Google? This is 2023)

3. Battery is much less if u compare it to older models. This is not a negative but it's because of the newer better performing processor. Actually if u enable battery saver it does save a lot of battery, especially on mobile data. Using the phone under wifi networks have me sufficient charge.",5

Camera -5, awesome camera quality.

Good phone in 30 k price.
Initial days heating observed for 2 to 3 days , after regular use I have not observed the heating issue.
Since my usage is not that heavy, battery works for me with nominal calling , what's app and video watch for a 9 to 10 hours.

PROS

Camera : 5/5 Camera is the best. It's better than iPhones. My iPhone user friends are appreciating it's camera. However, I'm yet to test the video. I bought it because of it's Camera and looks.

Design: 5/5 Excellent design and looks. iPhones are very common these days and being owner of this unique phone brings sense of pride. People just love my phone when they see it.


CONS

Battery : 4/5 Battery backup is awesome but not that great. Lasts enough just like iPhones. Charges 60% in just an hour which is great enough for me because I never charge my phone to 100%. I don't understand why people are complaining about it.

Fingerprint: 1/5 Fingerprint doesn't work well after recent updates to Android 14. I hope Google find the fix to this issue soon.

Display : Not that great, I guess. Sometimes touch didn't work properly for me. I don't know if I got defective one.",5

Day to day tasks are very smooth,
Take very good photos. No editing like color enhance or anything is done on the attached photos.
Tried playing BGMI, performance was smooth in game almost constant 60 fps but heats up while gaming so you can't play high end games for long.

I got the update the same day I got my phone so I updated it to Android 14, and all the reviews are based on that experience

Heated when I was setting the phone up, which included transferring of app and data from my old phone to this one and during the first 2 updates.

After that i didn't face any issues with the heating in normal usage, still heats on graphic intensive tasks though, but again almost every phone heats up my old realme heats up too and even iqoo 9 Se of my brother but pixel heats up relatively quickly than iQoo 9Se, hell even iPhone 15 pro Max heats up.

Battery backup was below average on the first two days then it started to improve, Google does some ai magic in the background.

Now it can easily handle a day for medium usage. Today itself the screen on time is around 6 hour 10 minutes and it still had 21 % battery left. It has been around 24 hours since I last charged it. I guess it will give around 1.5 hours more SOT.

On the first day it was around 4.5 hours today it will be 7.5-8 hours of SOT. But today I didn't do any graphic intensive task apart from recording a 1080p 60 fps video for around 30 minutes .

And my screen refresh rate is set to smooth 90hz",5

- performance is good ,no jitters and even 60hz feels smooth enough.
- haptics are good üëç
- charging is slow ü¶• but battery last's long so not a big issue.(2HRS WITH NORMAL CHARGER)
- 5G connectivity issues are there as of now, (and heating occurs only while using 5G and maps) 4G works just üëç awesome (these issues should be resolved with temperature going down in India after Summers and with updates too.
- the processor is capable enough to run and multi task heavy apps so no worries on the performance part.
- besides these things there is nothing to worry, everything is üòé Awesome.



Will Update after a month

- Feels like adaptive thing really works great according to the usage, satisfied.
-update like feature drop does'nt releases for every phone at a time, it's in batches.
-heatings get's controlled ig after somedays of usage
-Connectivity usage are resolved for me as of now.

camera

performance
software support
display (90hz is good coming from 120hz it's good doesn't feel too much of difference)

corn
slow charging (18watt max).
battery backup is not great but acceptable.
heats the top left aluminium frame. it will get warm on normal day to day tasks, it's bearable (every phone heats that much) but when you run benchmark or do software updates then it gets pretty hot like a lot.
bezels are quite huge
price (if you get around 30k then it's good but 40k is too much )

i have given it 5 stars because i got the device for around 27.5k (including exchange and bank offers), for that price the phone is totally worth it and value for money. if i would have bought the same device for around 40k i would have given it a 3/5 stars.",5

*Camera is fantastic
*Battery will come for one day with the screen time of 5 hrs as per my charge cycle 15 to 95
*If u charge till 0 to 100 it will come easily 6.5 to 7 hrs Max
*If you use with full brightness then ur battery drain easily 20% within a hour for sure
*Display is good
The charging time would be like 1.30hrs for 15 to 95 percent,It may take less than 2 hrs for 0 to 100.

These battery life is only on normal usage like social media, calling,videos and scrolling web pages. I have not play any games in my phone
These are my overall experience about battery

Heating is still a BIG problem, even at 25C ambient temperature, the phone will start heating while doing the most basic stuff like scrolling through IG, video calling, YouTube/Netflix streaming or simply browsing the web. It really becomes uncomfortable to hold.

The camera is not as good as the Pixel 7, which is expected.

The front camera is very very weak in low light, too much noise reduction in video. Loss of details is evident.

Performance is fine, nothing extraordinary, there are lags and frame drops while multi tasking for swiping through heavy apps. It is irritating given the fact that same chip is used in 7 and 7pro.

Pure Android.
The display is good.
Inbuilt security chip/feature but it doesn't matter if you are using it for daily usage

Inbuilt AI feature and Google apps are best.

The only concern is battery and charging. With a 40-watt/20-watt fast charger, it is taking 6 hours to charge fully. I don't know why Google does this but it is not recommended to use this phone as a primary phone if you travel and mostly away from home",4

The phone is too good, it's so smooth at 90hz and the in hand feel is too premium and also the main thing is it's compact!
Camera- it is literally the best at this price range, I had iPhone 13 previously and this pixel takes much better and original colour photos than that!
Processor - the processor is good for normal use I tried bgmi and took the hot drop then it lagged like crazy but after 1 min it got stable and I was getting 55-60 fps constant at smooth extreme, though it's not a gaming device, it can run games with decent performance.
Battery - The battery is good, it takes approx 1.5 hrs to charge on original Samsung charger, and it drains a little fast while using camera and games but In scrolling, calls, normal tasks it is very great!
Display- The display is good and very responsive and pixel animations are so gorgeous but the full brightness feels low in outside conditions!
So overall I'd give 4.5/5 to this device, also this phone heated a lot while setting up for the first time and when I upgraded it to Android 14 but after that it has never heated a bit except it gets warm while using camera or games for long time!",5

2) Battery is OK last whole day with moderate use, but charging is slow.
3) Device heats little on calls, which is not good. But even the iPhone heats on video calls.
4) Screen/Display is awesome, tried increasing little system font. Letter and images are crisp.
5) Face recognition works only in light, which is utterly poor. So I'm just using touch ID which is just fine and secure.

It's been just one month, I'll update later. I got it in replacement with my 2.5 years old iPhone 11 128 GB. For me it's worth it as the camera and screen are far better than the iPhone 11.

Battery: if you are heavy user probably you will need to change during the day, else will just make it till the end of the day. Also wait for the device to optimise itself in 2-3 days post first time setup.
Charging: this is a bin negative and yes the charging speed is snail pace low...it take literally 2-3 hours to get fully charged.
Overheating: does get warm up during hefty usage otherwise it's fine. Also just to draw a comparison, we are mi and realme people compared to it it's not even warm ü§£
Jokes apart yes it gets warm but upon heavy usage and if you have restricted background apps then that too will get resolved.
Performance: absolute delight all apps and tasks run butter smooth, not a gamer though but played few light games ran fine.
UI experience: flawless...90hz display is not enabled by default but once you enable it...it becomes whole different experience.
Display: display is good quality OLED, no complaints but yes little less Max brightness so direct under the sun visibility is good not great.

Finally: would recommend it as it's a great phone and ticks most of the qualities one looks for in a device. Only problem I see is the battery, if your usage is high then this is not the device for you. As battery won't last long and you will stay plugged for a very long time to add some.",5

Lets talk about it.....

Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome.
A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature only.

Performance: Not the best processor in the market in this price tag but definitely the smartest processor in any price range. Not even iphone is close to its smartness. This is not a gaming phone rather one should buy this phone for AI experience.

Design: 9/10 because of its unique design. 1 minus for glossy finish, matte would have been more premium. Though built quality is very good n premium.
This phone never lagged after 2 weeks of experience. Very few minor bugs. Best android experience.

Battery: In comparison to other flagships this is a great battery. Full day battery for casual users.Heating issue solved after update.
*Other than this fingerprint sensor was failing frequently but it is decently fast. After software updating 80% issue is now solved.
Other experience are very good.
*Best Haptic engine, better than any phone.",4

Was having a heating issue initially, temprature used to goes upto 43 Celcius. I was worried and was thinking to replace. But after a week of use everything went to normal haven't faced heating problem afterwards. Maybe because of optimization. Same goes for battery performance. Initially I was getting 4 to 4.5 hour of screen on time. But after week or 10 days of usage it started getting improved, now I almost get 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time.

Display: The oled display is good.
Charging: I have purchased 20w pd charger from Dr. Vaku, it charges faster. Croma chargers can also be an option.

Display is awesome with 90 HZ refresh rate. 5/5 in this zone to Google.

2) Sound is also good with stereo speakers, however could have been a bit louder similar to 7 Pro.

3) I love how the haptics are programmed in every pixle phone, they are just out of the world incomparable

4) Battery is kind of Ok, for me it does work for 24 hours with about 4 - 4.5 hours of Screen On Time

5) Cameras, for me its just average. Great for Still and Night Shots, good action Pan effects as well but the photos are overprocessed when it comes to Human subjects from Rear Camera. They get oversharpened and are sometimes kind of unusable. Also, the computational software of Google is inconsistent as it was in Pixel 6. Video shooting has improved a bit. The new Cinematic mode is a joke, the camera does not know how to calculate the focal distance at all So, if you are buying for 9* or 10* camera performance, it will not work. Samsung and Iphone camera is better in terms of overall quality and consistency.",4

Pixel has the best camera in terms of Still photos, and over-all camera is justüî•

I thought switching to stock Android will have less features then other skins, but there are a lot of Pixel only features which make up for them.

The processor is very good for AI and Audio processing tasks, i haven't seen such accuracy with Google Assistant on any device.

Main Camera - Amazing !! If you are looking for the best camera phone under 40k, go for it.... Far better than those blurry iphone photos....Night mode is out of the world.... Best in class... But no 50mp photo... Felt very helpless for that....
2. Wide angle camera - Not that wide, but clear and visible details comes from this camera, with good amount of low light capability.
3. Performance - For day to day task, it is more than enough... For casual gaming also, it is very good, but not for hardcore gamers. For students and professionals, who just do their any kind of work, click photos, and do other stuff, it is pretty good.
4. Selfie Camera - Selfies are good, not bad actually, but don't expect best in class selfie. Other smartphones have way better selfie cameras.
5. Video - Video is the most underrated feature of Pixel. It actually shoots very good videos from both the cameras.
6. Display - Best in class. Though 120hz is missing, but you can't feel it. 90hz is very good for them who are coming from 60hz, and even it feels faster.
7. Haptics - Best in class, in some case better than iphone also.
8. Software experience - Very very good, after One ui ( Samsung S Series), the best android ui is this, the stock.... Shows what android can do...
9. Customisation Features - It isn't that customisable as Samsung, but it is good.
10. Battery - Good for them, who play less game in daytime,( Assuming daytime is the main concern for battery life ) can get easily 1.5 day of backup. A normal user gets one day backup, but if you are a hardcore user, who just uses phone all the day, you have to charge twice a day.
11. Charging - Could have been better... I don't have a google brick.... I charge with my 67w macbook pro charger.... And it is super slow....üòÖüòÖ
12. Build - Feels premium...",4

Feels premium for sure. With glass back and metal body.
Camera best in class.
Good call quality.
Good network not as people complain about not receiving signal. I had no issue with network. Catches 5g easily.
Haptics feel premium.
Dual speakers. Main speaker is the right one. Left is the mic.
Buttons are tactile which I prefer as it gives the mechanical sound.
OS is smooth af. Preferences may vary as even I would like some changes. For example no double tap to lock screen. No call recording. To clear all the background apps you have to scroll all the way to left unlike in other Android phones where you can just clear all by pressing the clear all just below the apps.

Cons:
Battery drains fast.
No double tap to lock screen.
No inbuilt call recording.
Heats up while using camera. Although cools down fast as soon as the camera is closed. May heat a little outdoor but can be managed. It's not bad as people complain. Not like redmi in earlier days where one can't even touch.
Haven't checked while playing games. Since I am a regular user.

Purchase suggestion:
Buy if the phone price drops to 45k to 46k.
I bought it for 46k with big bachat sale and card offer. So got around 3k off.
If you want clean experience with no bloatwares go for it. This will give you pure Android experience.
Battery last 5 to 6 hours if used for light tasks. Ideally lasts for half a day. Needs to be charged in the evening if battery is fully charged in the morning.
Not for heavy users who like specific performance like gaming for 3-4 hours at a stretch. As this phone may heat up and has a small battery.
No lagging even for tensor chip and 90 hz display.
I have compared this phone with one plus by visiting one plus store. One plus 11 even though has SD 8 gen 1 felt laggy compared to this phone although one plus may have less heating and better gaming. Scrolling through apps and other apps feels damn smooth.

So conclusion is if you're getting this phone at an offer, want good camera, good os, and smooth experience go for it.
If not go for other brands like one plus.",4

Not the best but still good though it's not a gaming phone, it could handle games just fine. It's enough for a casual gamer. The cameras are really good. One of the best for the price. If you live in a place where there is reception issues then then look out for the pixel connectivity issues because this phone has a weaker modem than the other samsungs and iPhones of the world. Overall, I think it's worth for the price. You are getting a phone that's recent as well as priced good. If you're looking for the other phones in the market you have to go for s22 or the iPhone 13 which or any year old at the point.

Pros :
1.Classy camera especially the night shots are amazing, selfie is also best in class.
2.very smooth user experience, No need to talk about the stock Android and updates from google.
3.Premium design and the haptics are awesome.
4. You will not face any issues for daily usage, adding this because many people says it heats while doing daily tasks as well.

Cons:
1. Fingerprint sensor, For me it works smoothly for left thumb but when it comes for right thumb it won't work properly.
2. Heating issues, If you are hardcore gamer or you live where the temperature is always high. Then please don't consider this one as it's gonna heat a lot if you play games more than 1 or 1.5 hours or the surrounding is around 40 degrees.

PS: can't say anything about tensor chip as it's sometimes pro and sometimes con for me

Initially I was a bit hesitant because of charging speed and overall battery capacity as on the other hand some phones were providing 100W of fast charging. However, I finally decided to go ahead with the Pixel 7 because of its machine learning capabilities.

Performance - 4.5/5
Tensor G2 has done a great job and everything feels smooth and snappy. Haptics are great.

Display - 3.5/5
90 Hz refresh rate is kinda good. Though the peak brightness is 1400 yet in direct sunlight the screen is not visible clearly.

Overall build - 4/5
Gorilla glass victus on front and back. The back is glass so it slips alot.

Camera - 4.5/5
Pixels are known for their cameras. Natural photos with good dynamic range. Moreover, if you are thinking of buying pixel then it's mostly because of cameras so I won't write too much.

Battery - 3/5
Here comes the weakest point from my perspective. It takes 1hr 40 mins to fully charge. Battery sometimes provide full day backup and sometimes degrades before the end of the day. I work from home so I do use the phone every now and then.
And I use Dr Vaku 30 watt PD charger which delivers rapid charging.

Some perks of pixel 7 - 5/5
1. Remove people from the background works fantastic.
2. You can use Bokeh mode on any old photos.
3. Translation option automatically appears if you are reading anything in Hindi or other language.
4. Unblur feature is also great.
5. 'Now playing' feature is amazing which listens to songs playing in background and lets you know which song it is.
6. Extra dim and extreme battery saver are 2 great options for saving battery.
7. Always on display works very well.
8. Last point, unfortunately from pixel 6 there is no unlimited storage option available. I confirmed this from Google support community.",4

So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this.
1)Raw performance
2)long gaming sessions
3)Top of the line Hardware features.

If you get this phone you can expect the below
1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.

Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.

2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.

3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.

4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.

5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..

6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone

So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.

I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.",5

Camera quality - quite good performs well at every scenario but the front camera falls behind in low light conditions.

Connectivity - don't have any issue cuz I mostly wifi user

Build quality and design - I absolutely build and design as it stands out from the competition, look and feel very good in hand better than iphone 14,

Performance - performance is kind a mehh.. but very quick and good for daily driver cuz app opening and loading is quite fast and smooth it never hangs boot up quite fast everything here is buttery smooth. But yeah not for power users

Battery - as I am coming from pixel 6a it's very good battery I wanted to buy new phone cuz my old one cannot get me a full day when I m on travel but this one easily does so o complains at all

Display - very good at this price I know it's 90 hz but animation and all are smoothest and it is quite bright also used in harsh sunlight no problem at all easily visible

Some cons-
Front camera, fingerprint reader, slight heating issues but not that much",5

Overall, this is an all-rounder device with a good battery, great display, and a fantastic camera and software experience.

The build quality is very premium as expected. The design is good to look at and the device is steady when kept on a flat surface (no wobbling due to camera module design). It's a tad bit slippery, so it'll be a good idea to use a back cover.

The display is crisp and the touch and haptic response is great. The 90Hz refresh rate is good, but a 120Hz would be something many would have expected at this price point. The colour saturation is good.

The software experience is an absolute delight. No bloatware, clean Android experience, useful Google features, no lags. Haven't tested any games (honestly, didn't buy this device for gaming).

The battery is good and lasts the entire day with moderate usage. One can even go for a day with heavy usage if you switch to battery saver mode when the device is low on juice. I have managed an SOT of around 5.5 hours on average, with a high of 8 hours. The charging, though, is a bit of a disappointment. It's slow and can take about 1hr 45mins to charge fully. At this price point, one would expect faster charging.

And lastly, the camera. It's absolutely stellar. The pictures are crisp with good detail and real-to-life colours. The image processing of Google is just superb. Low-light pictures come out great with Night Sight. Portraits are good, but edge detection on subjects can be improved. Haven't got a chance to test out the other modes like Cinematic Blur, Motion with Action Pan, Astrophotography, etc.",5

My suggestion don't go for OnePlus or s22 at this range. Pixel 7 is really value for money.

Another reason I opted for 7 instead of 7pro because same primary sensor which same. Most of the time we click picture from main camera.. so not so much interested in telephoto or macro lens. 30 more is too much difference.",5

Camera expected to be more than enough.
Not much bloatware.

But when I surfed for Google phones last 5 months. I was really appreciating moment for me that I will have one of this for me.

I have used all this phones like:-

Nokia 1650, Music Xpress in 2009
Samsung keypad 2010
Nokia Lumia 9 series, Micromax Canvas A in 2013
Samsung S4 in 2013
Sony xperia z3 compact in 2014
Blackberry keyone note in 2017
Moto G4 Play
OnePlus 7T in 2019
Realme X2 in 2019
Mi A3 in 2019

After using all the above phones few which were my favourites. But because of battery and OS issues I had to now and than buy expensive phones

Samsung S4
Sony xperia z3 compact
Blackberry keyone note
Realme X2

Now finally having Google Pixel 7 last till 2027.
Want i want is there 6'.1 display, limited camera, software updates till 5 years, high end security options, maximum phone settings, use as u want, 128 gb internal storage, best display, if u don't use internet and keep phone on extreme battery saver it will last for 72 hours i.e., 3 days till noon etc.,

Every month security update is available only by Wi-Fi so as there is no load on phone hardware.

Go for this phone as this is only and only available on Flipkart don't buy from any of e-commerce because Google customer team has already guided me online that they authorised only to Flipkart and no any other business partner.

The battery was not that good, I use mobile all day and I need to charge the battery 3 times but On 10th October, I have updated it to Android 14 and now the battery is working much better and the heating issue is there but we can ignore that because when we charge the phone it gets heated but after some time when you use it it manages well with the heating and maintains a decent temperature.
I used to play BGMI and the performance is awesome, no lagging just some heating issue üòé.

The form factor is super amazing. it feels good in hand and that's it. That's all I can praise about this phone.

The biggest issue is the fingerprint scanner. It's pretty inaccurate, doesn't work half of the time. And if you've installed a tempered glass forget about using the fingerprint scanner. It just stops working.

I'd used OnePlus 7T for 3 years before switching to Pixel 7 and I'm missing the super fast fingerprint scanner, fast charging and alert slider. Even the Tensor G2 is not that fast. to me it doesn't feel like I've upgraded my phone which is disappointing.

You have to charge twice in a day for normal usage.
The mobile heating issue is there, except the camera rest of the phone is normal like 1plus and family.
Don't even try to play game on this phone your battery will drain in hour.

Camera is very reliable and takes good shots in broad daylight.

2. Phone overheats quickly even in air conditioned rooms
3. Network issue is still there. 5g reception is very weak.

Coming to the pros:-

1. Camera is really awesome the pics are really good.
2. Performance is good. No ads ntg. Pure Android
3. Feels like a very premium phone.
4. Display fingerprint everything is running smooth.
5. Battery backup is good and lasts 1 day for me in weekdays and in weekends sometimes I need to top-up once.

Coming to the cons:-

1. It takes around 1 and half hour for a full charge with Google 30W charger. but that's okay for me
2. Not a gaming phone

That's it. No cons founded till now, will.update if there are any.

Lets talk about it.....

Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome.
A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature only.

Performance: Not the best processor in the market in this price tag but definitely the smartest processor in any price range. Not even iphone is close to its smartness. This is not a gaming phone rather one should buy this phone for AI experience.

Design: 9/10 because of its unique design. 1 minus for glossy finish, matte would have been more premium. Though built quality is very good n premium.
This phone never lagged after 2 weeks of experience. Very few minor bugs. Best android experience.

Battery: In comparison to other flagships this is a great battery. Full day battery for casual users.Heating issue solved after update.
*Other than this fingerprint sensor was failing frequently but it is decently fast. After software updating 80% issue is now solved.
Other experience are very good.
*Best Haptic engine, better than any phone.",4

Was having a heating issue initially, temprature used to goes upto 43 Celcius. I was worried and was thinking to replace. But after a week of use everything went to normal haven't faced heating problem afterwards. Maybe because of optimization. Same goes for battery performance. Initially I was getting 4 to 4.5 hour of screen on time. But after week or 10 days of usage it started getting improved, now I almost get 5.5 to 6 hours of screen on time.

Camera: Its great. Video stabilization at 4k 60 fps is good, and smooth. It cannot beat Iphone though, regarding color tonality and sometimes dynamics as well, myself having switched from iPhone 11. Even then, camera specs would stand next to iPhone.
Battery: The battery life is good, good enough to last 11+ hrs with moderate usage.
Display: The oled display is good.
Charging: I have purchased 20w pd charger from Dr. Vaku, it charges faster. Croma chargers can also be an option.

Display is awesome with 90 HZ refresh rate. 5/5 in this zone to Google.

2) Sound is also good with stereo speakers, however could have been a bit louder similar to 7 Pro.

3) I love how the haptics are programmed in every pixle phone, they are just out of the world incomparable

4) Battery is kind of Ok, for me it does work for 24 hours with about 4 - 4.5 hours of Screen On Time

5) Cameras, for me its just average. Great for Still and Night Shots, good action Pan effects as well but the photos are overprocessed when it comes to Human subjects from Rear Camera. They get oversharpened and are sometimes kind of unusable. Also, the computational software of Google is inconsistent as it was in Pixel 6. Video shooting has improved a bit. The new Cinematic mode is a joke, the camera does not know how to calculate the focal distance at all So, if you are buying for 9* or 10* camera performance, it will not work. Samsung and Iphone camera is better in terms of overall quality and consistency.",4

I thought switching to stock Android will have less features then other skins, but there are a lot of Pixel only features which make up for them.

Main Camera - Amazing !! If you are looking for the best camera phone under 40k, go for it.... Far better than those blurry iphone photos....Night mode is out of the world.... Best in class... But no 50mp photo... Felt very helpless for that....
2. Wide angle camera - Not that wide, but clear and visible details comes from this camera, with good amount of low light capability.
3. Performance - For day to day task, it is more than enough... For casual gaming also, it is very good, but not for hardcore gamers. For students and professionals, who just do their any kind of work, click photos, and do other stuff, it is pretty good.
4. Selfie Camera - Selfies are good, not bad actually, but don't expect best in class selfie. Other smartphones have way better selfie cameras.
5. Video - Video is the most underrated feature of Pixel. It actually shoots very good videos from both the cameras.
6. Display - Best in class. Though 120hz is missing, but you can't feel it. 90hz is very good for them who are coming from 60hz, and even it feels faster.
7. Haptics - Best in class, in some case better than iphone also.
8. Software experience - Very very good, after One ui ( Samsung S Series), the best android ui is this, the stock.... Shows what android can do...
9. Customisation Features - It isn't that customisable as Samsung, but it is good.
10. Battery - Good for them, who play less game in daytime,( Assuming daytime is the main concern for battery life ) can get easily 1.5 day of backup. A normal user gets one day backup, but if you are a hardcore user, who just uses phone all the day, you have to charge twice a day.
11. Charging - Could have been better... I don't have a google brick.... I charge with my 67w macbook pro charger.... And it is super slow....üòÖüòÖ

Feels premium for sure. With glass back and metal body.
Camera best in class.
Good call quality.
Good network not as people complain about not receiving signal. I had no issue with network. Catches 5g easily.
Haptics feel premium.
Dual speakers. Main speaker is the right one. Left is the mic.
Buttons are tactile which I prefer as it gives the mechanical sound.
OS is smooth af. Preferences may vary as even I would like some changes. For example no double tap to lock screen. No call recording. To clear all the background apps you have to scroll all the way to left unlike in other Android phones where you can just clear all by pressing the clear all just below the apps.

Cons:
Battery drains fast.
No double tap to lock screen.
No inbuilt call recording.
Heats up while using camera. Although cools down fast as soon as the camera is closed. May heat a little outdoor but can be managed. It's not bad as people complain. Not like redmi in earlier days where one can't even touch.
Haven't checked while playing games. Since I am a regular user.

Purchase suggestion:
Buy if the phone price drops to 45k to 46k.
I bought it for 46k with big bachat sale and card offer. So got around 3k off.
If you want clean experience with no bloatwares go for it. This will give you pure Android experience.
Battery last 5 to 6 hours if used for light tasks. Ideally lasts for half a day. Needs to be charged in the evening if battery is fully charged in the morning.
Not for heavy users who like specific performance like gaming for 3-4 hours at a stretch. As this phone may heat up and has a small battery.
No lagging even for tensor chip and 90 hz display.
I have compared this phone with one plus by visiting one plus store. One plus 11 even though has SD 8 gen 1 felt laggy compared to this phone although one plus may have less heating and better gaming. Scrolling through apps and other apps feels damn smooth.

So conclusion is if you're getting this phone at an offer, want good camera, good os, and smooth experience go for it.
If not go for other brands like one plus.",4

It's fast. Beautiful has good cameras for normal photos. Portraits cinematic are just not really that good but normal video is also good. Not the best but still good though it's not a gaming phone, it could handle games just fine. It's enough for a casual gamer. The cameras are really good. One of the best for the price. If you live in a place where there is reception issues then then look out for the pixel connectivity issues because this phone has a weaker modem than the other samsungs and iPhones of the world. Overall, I think it's worth for the price. You are getting a phone that's recent as well as priced good. If you're looking for the other phones in the market you have to go for s22 or the iPhone 13 which or any year old at the point.

Pros :
1.Classy camera especially the night shots are amazing, selfie is also best in class.
2.very smooth user experience, No need to talk about the stock Android and updates from google.
3.Premium design and the haptics are awesome.
4. You will not face any issues for daily usage, adding this because many people says it heats while doing daily tasks as well.

Cons:
1. Fingerprint sensor, For me it works smoothly for left thumb but when it comes for right thumb it won't work properly.
2. Heating issues, If you are hardcore gamer or you live where the temperature is always high. Then please don't consider this one as it's gonna heat a lot if you play games more than 1 or 1.5 hours or the surrounding is around 40 degrees.

Initially I was a bit hesitant because of charging speed and overall battery capacity as on the other hand some phones were providing 100W of fast charging. However, I finally decided to go ahead with the Pixel 7 because of its machine learning capabilities.

Performance - 4.5/5
Tensor G2 has done a great job and everything feels smooth and snappy. Haptics are great.

Display - 3.5/5
90 Hz refresh rate is kinda good. Though the peak brightness is 1400 yet in direct sunlight the screen is not visible clearly.

Overall build - 4/5
Gorilla glass victus on front and back. The back is glass so it slips alot.

Camera - 4.5/5
Pixels are known for their cameras. Natural photos with good dynamic range. Moreover, if you are thinking of buying pixel then it's mostly because of cameras so I won't write too much.

Battery - 3/5
Here comes the weakest point from my perspective. It takes 1hr 40 mins to fully charge. Battery sometimes provide full day backup and sometimes degrades before the end of the day. I work from home so I do use the phone every now and then.
And I use Dr Vaku 30 watt PD charger which delivers rapid charging.

Some perks of pixel 7 - 5/5
1. Remove people from the background works fantastic.
2. You can use Bokeh mode on any old photos.
3. Translation option automatically appears if you are reading anything in Hindi or other language.
4. Unblur feature is also great.
5. 'Now playing' feature is amazing which listens to songs playing in background and lets you know which song it is.
6. Extra dim and extreme battery saver are 2 great options for saving battery.
7. Always on display works very well.

So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this.
1)Raw performance
2)long gaming sessions
3)Top of the line Hardware features.

If you get this phone you can expect the below
1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.

Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.

2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.

3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.

4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.

5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..

6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone

So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.

I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.",5

Camera quality - quite good performs well at every scenario but the front camera falls behind in low light conditions.

Connectivity - don't have any issue cuz I mostly wifi user

Build quality and design - I absolutely build and design as it stands out from the competition, look and feel very good in hand better than iphone 14,

Performance - performance is kind a mehh.. but very quick and good for daily driver cuz app opening and loading is quite fast and smooth it never hangs boot up quite fast everything here is buttery smooth. But yeah not for power users

Battery - as I am coming from pixel 6a it's very good battery I wanted to buy new phone cuz my old one cannot get me a full day when I m on travel but this one easily does so o complains at all

Display - very good at this price I know it's 90 hz but animation and all are smoothest and it is quite bright also used in harsh sunlight no problem at all easily visible

Some cons-
Front camera, fingerprint reader, slight heating issues but not that much",5

Overall, this is an all-rounder device with a good battery, great display, and a fantastic camera and software experience.

The build quality is very premium as expected. The design is good to look at and the device is steady when kept on a flat surface (no wobbling due to camera module design). It's a tad bit slippery, so it'll be a good idea to use a back cover.

The display is crisp and the touch and haptic response is great. The 90Hz refresh rate is good, but a 120Hz would be something many would have expected at this price point. The colour saturation is good.

The software experience is an absolute delight. No bloatware, clean Android experience, useful Google features, no lags. Haven't tested any games (honestly, didn't buy this device for gaming).

The battery is good and lasts the entire day with moderate usage. One can even go for a day with heavy usage if you switch to battery saver mode when the device is low on juice. I have managed an SOT of around 5.5 hours on average, with a high of 8 hours. The charging, though, is a bit of a disappointment. It's slow and can take about 1hr 45mins to charge fully. At this price point, one would expect faster charging.

And lastly, the camera. It's absolutely stellar. The pictures are crisp with good detail and real-to-life colours. The image processing of Google is just superb. Low-light pictures come out great with Night Sight. Portraits are good, but edge detection on subjects can be improved. Haven't got a chance to test out the other modes like Cinematic Blur, Motion with Action Pan, Astrophotography, etc.",5

Camera - top notch
Performance - snapy n fast
Battery performance - decent. Last for more than 12 hrs on heavy and moderate use.

People are cribbing about charging time 1.5hrs . I feel it still ok as last for more time no need to change again n gain. Think you are getting top notch product at this price

My suggestion don't go for OnePlus or s22 at this range. Pixel 7 is really value for money.

Another reason I opted for 7 instead of 7pro because same primary sensor which same. Most of the time we click picture from main camera.. so not so much interested in telephoto or macro lens. 30 more is too much difference.",5

Camera expected to be more than enough.
Not much bloatware.

But when I surfed for Google phones last 5 months. I was really appreciating moment for me that I will have one of this for me.

I have used all this phones like:-

Nokia 1650, Music Xpress in 2009
Samsung keypad 2010
Nokia Lumia 9 series, Micromax Canvas A in 2013
Samsung S4 in 2013
Sony xperia z3 compact in 2014
Blackberry keyone note in 2017
Moto G4 Play
OnePlus 7T in 2019
Realme X2 in 2019
Mi A3 in 2019

After using all the above phones few which were my favourites. But because of battery and OS issues I had to now and than buy expensive phones

Samsung S4
Sony xperia z3 compact
Blackberry keyone note
Realme X2

Now finally having Google Pixel 7 last till 2027.
Want i want is there 6'.1 display, limited camera, software updates till 5 years, high end security options, maximum phone settings, use as u want, 128 gb internal storage, best display, if u don't use internet and keep phone on extreme battery saver it will last for 72 hours i.e., 3 days till noon etc.,

Every month security update is available only by Wi-Fi so as there is no load on phone hardware.

Go for this phone as this is only and only available on Flipkart don't buy from any of e-commerce because Google customer team has already guided me online that they authorised only to Flipkart and no any other business partner.

One issue with this Google phone is the emergency accident alert is not available in Asia continent.",5

It's just a decent branded phone.

The form factor is super amazing. it feels good in hand and that's it. That's all I can praise about this phone.

The biggest issue is the fingerprint scanner. It's pretty inaccurate, doesn't work half of the time. And if you've installed a tempered glass forget about using the fingerprint scanner. It just stops working.

I'd used OnePlus 7T for 3 years before switching to Pixel 7 and I'm missing the super fast fingerprint scanner, fast charging and alert slider. Even the Tensor G2 is not that fast. to me it doesn't feel like I've upgraded my phone which is disappointing.

If you're using Pixel7 with tempered glass and fingerprint scanner is working for you please comment here. I would like to connect with you.",3

Camera is very reliable and takes good shots in broad daylight.
2. Haptics are crisp
3. Almost have a compact feel while holding and really good design.
4. Clean software as promised with zero bloatware na d ads.

Con:
1. Black bar appears in several apps ( both top and bottom) in landscape mode. A bug yet to be resolved.
2. Phone overheats quickly even in air conditioned rooms
3. Network issue is still there. 5g reception is very weak.

Conclusion:

Its cons overpower its camera quality so I would recommend to wait for Pixel 8 or chose other devise all together as in pixel 8 too they are coming with tensor g3 so same problems could be there.",3

Bought it for 40Kchange in the sale by keeping exchange of my old phone Redmi note 8 Pro which gave me a good amount of 8600.

Coming to the pros:-

1. Camera is really awesome the pics are really good.
2. Performance is good. No ads ntg. Pure Android
3. Feels like a very premium phone.
4. Display fingerprint everything is running smooth.
5. Battery backup is good and lasts 1 day for me in weekdays and in weekends sometimes I need to top-up once.

Coming to the cons:-

1. It takes around 1 and half hour for a full charge with Google 30W charger. but that's okay for me
2. Not a gaming phone

That's it. No cons founded till now, will.update if there are any.

Lets talk about it.....

Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome.
A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature only.

Performance: Not the best processor in the market in this price tag but definitely the smartest processor in any price range. Not even iphone is close to its smartness. This is not a gaming phone rather one should buy this phone for AI experience.

Design: 9/10 because of its unique design. 1 minus for glossy finish, matte would have been more premium. Though built quality is very good n premium.
This phone never lagged after 2 weeks of experience. Very few minor bugs. Best android experience.

Battery: In comparison to other flagships this is a great battery. Full day battery for casual users.Heating issue solved after update.
*Other than this fingerprint sensor was failing frequently but it is decently fast. After software updating 80% issue is now solved.
Other experience are very good.
*Best Haptic engine, better than any phone.",4

But after a week of use everything went to normal haven't faced heating problem afterwards. Maybe because of optimization. Same goes for battery performance.

The phone is lovely. Hands on feel is good.
Camera: Its great. Video stabilization at 4k 60 fps is good, and smooth. It cannot beat Iphone though, regarding color tonality and sometimes dynamics as well, myself having switched from iPhone 11. Even then, camera specs would stand next to iPhone.
Battery: The battery life is good, good enough to last 11+ hrs with moderate usage.
Display: The oled display is good.
Charging: I have purchased 20w pd charger from Dr. Vaku, it charges faster. Croma chargers can also be an option.
Note: I found no heating issue with this device. Only during the initial set up after purchase, did this phone heated up a bit, elsewise under heavy usage it tends to warm up a bit, but no extensive heating.",5

Display is awesome with 90 HZ refresh rate. 5/5 in this zone to Google.

2) Sound is also good with stereo speakers, however could have been a bit louder similar to 7 Pro.

3) I love how the haptics are programmed in every pixle phone, they are just out of the world incomparable

4) Battery is kind of Ok, for me it does work for 24 hours with about 4 - 4.5 hours of Screen On Time

5) Cameras, for me its just average. Great for Still and Night Shots, good action Pan effects as well but the photos are overprocessed when it comes to Human subjects from Rear Camera. They get oversharpened and are sometimes kind of unusable. Also, the computational software of Google is inconsistent as it was in Pixel 6. Video shooting has improved a bit. The new Cinematic mode is a joke, the camera does not know how to calculate the focal distance at all So, if you are buying for 9* or 10* camera performance, it will not work. Samsung and Iphone camera is better in terms of overall quality and consistency.",4

2. Wide angle camera - Not that wide, but clear and visible details comes from this camera, with good amount of low light capability.
3. Performance - For day to day task, it is more than enough... For casual gaming also, it is very good, but not for hardcore gamers. For students and professionals, who just do their any kind of work, click photos, and do other stuff, it is pretty good.
4. Selfie Camera - Selfies are good, not bad actually, but don't expect best in class selfie. Other smartphones have way better selfie cameras.
5. Video - Video is the most underrated feature of Pixel. It actually shoots very good videos from both the cameras.
6. Display - Best in class. Though 120hz is missing, but you can't feel it. 90hz is very good for them who are coming from 60hz, and even it feels faster.
7. Haptics - Best in class, in some case better than iphone also.
8. Software experience - Very very good, after One ui ( Samsung S Series), the best android ui is this, the stock.... Shows what android can do...
9. Customisation Features - It isn't that customisable as Samsung, but it is good.

Feels premium for sure. With glass back and metal body.
Camera best in class.
Good call quality.
Good network not as people complain about not receiving signal. I had no issue with network. Catches 5g easily.
Haptics feel premium.
Dual speakers. Main speaker is the right one. Left is the mic.
Buttons are tactile which I prefer as it gives the mechanical sound.
OS is smooth af. Preferences may vary as even I would like some changes. For example no double tap to lock screen. No call recording. To clear all the background apps you have to scroll all the way to left unlike in other Android phones where you can just clear all by pressing the clear all just below the apps.

Cons:
Battery drains fast.
No double tap to lock screen.
No inbuilt call recording.
Heats up while using camera. Although cools down fast as soon as the camera is closed. May heat a little outdoor but can be managed. It's not bad as people complain. Not like redmi in earlier days where one can't even touch.
Haven't checked while playing games. Since I am a regular user.

Purchase suggestion:
Buy if the phone price drops to 45k to 46k.
I bought it for 46k with big bachat sale and card offer. So got around 3k off.
If you want clean experience with no bloatwares go for it. This will give you pure Android experience.
Battery last 5 to 6 hours if used for light tasks. Ideally lasts for half a day. Needs to be charged in the evening if battery is fully charged in the morning.
Not for heavy users who like specific performance like gaming for 3-4 hours at a stretch. As this phone may heat up and has a small battery.
No lagging even for tensor chip and 90 hz display.
I have compared this phone with one plus by visiting one plus store. One plus 11 even though has SD 8 gen 1 felt laggy compared to this phone although one plus may have less heating and better gaming. Scrolling through apps and other apps feels damn smooth.

So conclusion is if you're getting this phone at an offer, want good camera, good os, and smooth experience go for it.
If not go for other brands like one plus.",4

Pros :
1.Classy camera especially the night shots are amazing, selfie is also best in class.
2.very smooth user experience, No need to talk about the stock Android and updates from google.
3.Premium design and the haptics are awesome.
4. You will not face any issues for daily usage, adding this because many people says it heats while doing daily tasks as well.

Cons:
1. Fingerprint sensor, For me it works smoothly for left thumb but when it comes for right thumb it won't work properly.
2. Heating issues, If you are hardcore gamer or you live where the temperature is always high. Then please don't consider this one as it's gonna heat a lot if you play games more than 1 or 1.5 hours or the surrounding is around 40 degrees.

Pros : The Cameraa ofcourse !
Design is very stylish , display is good , os is clean

Cons: Heating was my main problem. Without a case, we can feel the heat in the aluminium frame. But after 1st week it reduces, the phone studies our habits and somewhat rectifies.
Battery is okay for me but for 50k, it could be way better.
If you want to game, this phone is not for you. Processor is not that great.
Charging speed - Dear google, whyy 20w? Its slow but manageable. Charging block costs another K.
My advice : if you need a premium looking phone with good camera, go for it but if you are perfomance oriented, go for snapdragon processors.",4

Initially I was a bit hesitant because of charging speed and overall battery capacity as on the other hand some phones were providing 100W of fast charging. However, I finally decided to go ahead with the Pixel 7 because of its machine learning capabilities.

Performance - 4.5/5
Tensor G2 has done a great job and everything feels smooth and snappy. Haptics are great.

Display - 3.5/5
90 Hz refresh rate is kinda good. Though the peak brightness is 1400 yet in direct sunlight the screen is not visible clearly.

Overall build - 4/5
Gorilla glass victus on front and back. The back is glass so it slips alot.

Camera - 4.5/5
Pixels are known for their cameras. Natural photos with good dynamic range. Moreover, if you are thinking of buying pixel then it's mostly because of cameras so I won't write too much.

Battery - 3/5
Here comes the weakest point from my perspective. It takes 1hr 40 mins to fully charge. Battery sometimes provide full day backup and sometimes degrades before the end of the day. I work from home so I do use the phone every now and then.
And I use Dr Vaku 30 watt PD charger which delivers rapid charging.

Some perks of pixel 7 - 5/5
1. Remove people from the background works fantastic.
2. You can use Bokeh mode on any old photos.
3. Translation option automatically appears if you are reading anything in Hindi or other language.
4. Unblur feature is also great.
5. 'Now playing' feature is amazing which listens to songs playing in background and lets you know which song it is.
6. Extra dim and extreme battery saver are 2 great options for saving battery.
7. Always on display works very well.
8. Last point, unfortunately from pixel 6 there is no unlimited storage option available. I confirmed this from Google support community.",4

So first up if you are looking for the below things in a phone you should avoid this.
1)Raw performance
2)long gaming sessions
3)Top of the line Hardware features.

If you get this phone you can expect the below
1)cleanest android and day 1 release of updates no other android gets them..you can be like samsung offers 4 years of major update and google only 3 years of major OS updates.

Samsung phones that come out basically any phone before oct will only launch with the previous android version for example this year all samsung phones launched with android 12 while except the 6a the other two flagships of google launched with android 13 out of the box so technically Samsung's 4 years promise gets you till android 17 and so does these pixels.but still pixel will be the only android phone in the world that gets the every new update the first.

2)Top class camera-pixels get one of the best camera if not the best camera in the market if you are after potrait mode then samsung has mastered it you should look there if its video then apple mastered that but if its still photos and you want a consistent performer pixel is the one to get..apple and samsung have great cameras but in some scenarios google has them beat.

3)Software is the core-Pixels wont get the best hardware features but there software will be the smartest in the market..google assistant is the best assistant out there and other little features like you can turn off the alarm but saying stop in the morning,the phone has smart translate that automatically shows you an option to translate a text that you received in every platform and many others which are geo blocked in india due to obvious reasons you can't expect a google assistant to pick a call for you here and converse in english the other person might not speak the same language. Not often spoken about the best feature is you go contacts and start typing about a business and the phone automatically picks up there number if it is on google i don't why has no one ever spoke about this has been with pixel for over 2 years now.

4)the battery for me is covering a whole day of moderate use i have been getting consistently 6+ hours of screen on time with 15% charge left.let the phone learn you pattern the first two days.

5) Charging times are slower compared to the chinese counterparts but for me i charge over night so its okay but i wont deny that i may some day find the slower speeds but the highest 33 watt pretty slow..

6)the haptics are wonderful on pixels I have always loved them They are indeed the best haptics in a phone

So if you are looking for a great software experience then pixel is the one to get but if you like the top of the lines hardware features you can choose another phone.

I am speaking like a user of 5 years with pixels and not as a fanboy..so spend your money wisely if this doesn't suit your needs skip the pixel.",5

Camera quality - quite good performs well at every scenario but the front camera falls behind in low light conditions.

Connectivity - don't have any issue cuz I mostly wifi user

Build quality and design - I absolutely build and design as it stands out from the competition, look and feel very good in hand better than iphone 14,

Performance - performance is kind a mehh.. but very quick and good for daily driver cuz app opening and loading is quite fast and smooth it never hangs boot up quite fast everything here is buttery smooth. But yeah not for power users

Battery - as I am coming from pixel 6a it's very good battery I wanted to buy new phone cuz my old one cannot get me a full day when I m on travel but this one easily does so o complains at all

Display - very good at this price I know it's 90 hz but animation and all are smoothest and it is quite bright also used in harsh sunlight no problem at all easily visible

Some cons-
Front camera, fingerprint reader, slight heating issues but not that much",5

Overall, this is an all-rounder device with a good battery, great display, and a fantastic camera and software experience.

The build quality is very premium as expected. The design is good to look at and the device is steady when kept on a flat surface (no wobbling due to camera module design). It's a tad bit slippery, so it'll be a good idea to use a back cover.

The display is crisp and the touch and haptic response is great. The 90Hz refresh rate is good, but a 120Hz would be something many would have expected at this price point. The colour saturation is good.

The software experience is an absolute delight. No bloatware, clean Android experience, useful Google features, no lags. Haven't tested any games (honestly, didn't buy this device for gaming).

The battery is good and lasts the entire day with moderate usage. One can even go for a day with heavy usage if you switch to battery saver mode when the device is low on juice. I have managed an SOT of around 5.5 hours on average, with a high of 8 hours. The charging, though, is a bit of a disappointment. It's slow and can take about 1hr 45mins to charge fully. At this price point, one would expect faster charging.

And lastly, the camera. It's absolutely stellar. The pictures are crisp with good detail and real-to-life colours. The image processing of Google is just superb. Low-light pictures come out great with Night Sight. Portraits are good, but edge detection on subjects can be improved. Haven't got a chance to test out the other modes like Cinematic Blur, Motion with Action Pan, Astrophotography, etc.",5

Battery performance - decent. Last for more than 12 hrs on heavy and moderate use.

People are cribbing about charging time 1.5hrs . I feel it still ok as last for more time no need to change again n gain. Think you are getting top notch product at this price

My suggestion don't go for OnePlus or s22 at this range. Pixel 7 is really value for money.

Another reason I opted for 7 instead of 7pro because same primary sensor which same. Most of the time we click picture from main camera.. so not so much interested in telephoto or macro lens. 30 more is too much difference.",5

Camera expected to be more than enough.
Not much bloatware.

But when I surfed for Google phones last 5 months. I was really appreciating moment for me that I will have one of this for me.

I have used all this phones like:-

Nokia 1650, Music Xpress in 2009
Samsung keypad 2010
Nokia Lumia 9 series, Micromax Canvas A in 2013
Samsung S4 in 2013
Sony xperia z3 compact in 2014
Blackberry keyone note in 2017
Moto G4 Play
OnePlus 7T in 2019
Realme X2 in 2019
Mi A3 in 2019

After using all the above phones few which were my favourites. But because of battery and OS issues I had to now and than buy expensive phones

Samsung S4
Sony xperia z3 compact
Blackberry keyone note
Realme X2

Now finally having Google Pixel 7 last till 2027.
Want i want is there 6'.1 display, limited camera, software updates till 5 years, high end security options, maximum phone settings, use as u want, 128 gb internal storage, best display, if u don't use internet and keep phone on extreme battery saver it will last for 72 hours i.e., 3 days till noon etc.,

Every month security update is available only by Wi-Fi so as there is no load on phone hardware.

Go for this phone as this is only and only available on Flipkart don't buy from any of e-commerce because Google customer team has already guided me online that they authorised only to Flipkart and no any other business partner.

One issue with this Google phone is the emergency accident alert is not available in Asia continent.",5

Not crisp and typical OLED black and vivid as expected. SRGB calibration is off and there is no option to choose your own. Charging time is more, but once charged, battery drain is slow. Connectivity issues, both WIFI and mobile network. Constant disconnection, range issues etc. Camera is good though the hardware is last year's. Fingerprint scanner performance is bearable.

The form factor is super amazing. it feels good in hand and that's it. That's all I can praise about this phone.

The biggest issue is the fingerprint scanner. It's pretty inaccurate, doesn't work half of the time. And if you've installed a tempered glass forget about using the fingerprint scanner. It just stops working.

I'd used OnePlus 7T for 3 years before switching to Pixel 7 and I'm missing the super fast fingerprint scanner, fast charging and alert slider. Even the Tensor G2 is not that fast. to me it doesn't feel like I've upgraded my phone which is disappointing.

If you're using Pixel7 with tempered glass and fingerprint scanner is working for you please comment here. I would like to connect with you.",3

Camera is very reliable and takes good shots in broad daylight.
2. Haptics are crisp
3. Almost have a compact feel while holding and really good design.
4. Clean software as promised with zero bloatware na d ads.

Con:
1. Black bar appears in several apps ( both top and bottom) in landscape mode. A bug yet to be resolved.
2. Phone overheats quickly even in air conditioned rooms
3. Network issue is still there. 5g reception is very weak.

Conclusion:

Its cons overpower its camera quality so I would recommend to wait for Pixel 8 or chose other devise all together as in pixel 8 too they are coming with tensor g3 so same problems could be there.",3

Coming to the pros:-

1. Camera is really awesome the pics are really good.
2. Performance is good. No ads ntg. Pure Android
3. Feels like a very premium phone.
4. Display fingerprint everything is running smooth.
5. Battery backup is good and lasts 1 day for me in weekdays and in weekends sometimes I need to top-up once.

Coming to the cons:-

1. It takes around 1 and half hour for a full charge with Google 30W charger. but that's okay for me
2. Not a gaming phone

That's it. No cons founded till now, will.update if there are any.

excelllent build quality.
display is bright enough in full sunlight.
battery drops down to 30% end of the day which is more than enough for a average or higher average user. (AI optimizes battery as per user's usage)
no network issue found yet .. call quality is very good till now as compared to pixel 4a.
phones heats up during first set up but after andriod 14 update no such heavy heating observed.

thick bezel.
charging is a bit slow.

Pros.

Camera
Os
Display
Chip(not for extreme gaming) - optimized with os makes a better user experience. The chip delivers near flagship grade performance. But not the best chip for long gaming sessions

Cons

Charging time is a high

Heating is Normal but some times it heats a little. Maybe it's because of the two x1 chip design and the x1 is an ML powerhouse which is a big part of a Google design",5

1) Heating little more than other phones in this range.

2) Hanging, I am seeing extreme level of hanging in this phone. Recently I took a screenshot and the phone just hang there and nothing was working, after some try I used voice assistant to power off my device and now it works perfectly normal. I'm afraid this issue can be repeated.

3) network problem, and this one is very common in pixel 7 series phones.

Other than that everything works just fine and I'm happy about it. But Google has failed to solved some basic issues like hanging, network issues and battery life.",3

Its a perfect pocket friendly, premium android smartphone that one can ask for. I got it for 39999 which might not be the final price (as price generally drops for pixel mid range phones in a couple of months). Let me list down pros and cons below:

PROS:
1. The device feels good in ur hand. Its compact, color coding is good, buttons are tactile and the google logo gives it an edge. There is a 'Made in Taiwan' logo also which can be ignored as the font is very small.
2. The software experience of stock Android is simplly superb. It makes u feel easy as there r no unnecessary notifications, ads or apps.
3. The camera is a beast at this price point. The portrait shots are fabulous, low light photos are pretty dynamic yet natural. Image processing takes a tad bit long but produces some amazing shots.
4. Supports all 5g bands. Have tested on Airtel 5G+, and it performed extremely well with download speeds of upto 200 Mbps.
5. The pricing is just about correct for this device if you can get it for 39999. It will be one of the first phones to get Android 14 in which google is planning to do some good things (AI)
6. Face unlock works very good.
7. Multimedia experience is also very good with a vibrant HDR screen and power packed stereo speakers.

CONS:
1. Bezels on the screen make the screen look a bit outdated.
2. It does not come with allways on 90Hz refresh rate for the display. It auto switches between 60 and 90Hz depending on the requirement of the content to be displayed.
3. Battery life is good. Can easily last a day even after heavy usage. But charging at 18 watts is very slow. Can take 3 hrs for a full charge.

Rest assured, the phone looks good. If you have the budget, just go for it. It comes from Google, one of the biggest brands in the world. You won't be disappointed.",4

First of all let me start with the looks of the phone, it's a 6.1 inch full HD plus oled display. The colours are just too good.
Lets talk about the camera, I think this beats any other smartphone at this price range. Cameras are just flagship level and the colours are so accurate.
The speakers quality is top notch too.
Now the cons:
Dear google this phone feels like a heater releasing heat this summer. I mean fix the heating issue fast. Also the battery drains very fast.

Battery optimization is good. It drains slowly as compared with other devices. The heating issue is there but it doesn't affect its battery.
It's not a GAMING PHONE so don't compare it with SD gen1/2. (However my ANTUTU Score is 795666 in 28 degree room temperature)
Overall performance is great but AI features are making it unique. In this price you cannot get these features but Google made it possible.

Out of 5
Design - 5
(Metal frame and premium quality plastic back makes it more durable)
Display - 4.5 (size - 4, response/appearance - 5)
Camera - 5 (night mode is not that good but other features are best)

Performance - 4 (equivalent to almost SD 888)
Battery - 5

Value for money - 5

1. Heats up a lot. Battery drains too fast.
2. Battery alone makes it a phone that's a pain to live with.
3. Performance is also sub par.
4. You'll need a PD/PPS charger to charge it at an acceptable pace.

Software flaws.
1. Video over LTE calls are not supported. That means no Jio video calls, you'll need to use Meet or other apps to make a video call.
2. Call recording is not supported.
3. Switching mobile-data sim is a hassle. You'll need to dive deep into the settings to do that.

I bought original Google charger with this phone. The battery wasn't charging at all. After research in Google I disabled Adaptive charging. After that it started charging. But dead slow. Took 1 hr from 31 to 50% charge.

Heating issue also there. Heats badly like we can't hold the phone in hand.

This is my 1st day observation. Will update after using for few days..

Edit: 2nd day morning charged faster to 100%

Edit 2: Heating issue reduced after 2nd day of use. The battery was draining too fast. Restricted background activities of many Apps helped to reduce the draining speed.

Pros: Awesome camera quality. Accurate color. Low light. Excellent night shot.

Cons: Battery needs to be charged twice a day.

Although pixel phones doesn't do well Indian Market, I am happy that it is available through flipkart. Its quite pricey yet not regretful. Really liked the design. Since my previous phone is Pixel 6a, it is quite similar to its look and feel, so I do not feel that much of having a new phone as I did previously when upgrading from 4a to 6a.
One thing I notice is (been only using it for 2 days) that it seems the speaker is not better than my 6a.
Heating issues? Well, I know there have been so much complaints about the heating issue even before I bought it. But as a casual user, I did not find it a problem till now.

Great phone, glad to be a part of #teampixel. Looking forward to be a Pixel user in the future tooüòÅ",4

if u love taking photos and u love stock Android, get it

What has improved:

the pixel 7 is much faster than how generally we expect a pixel phone to be. Usually pixel phones are much slower compared to flagship but this time Google has nailed it with raw performance.

What to hate about it:
1. The 5g modem in this is garbage. I use it with 5g disabled and on LTE. If u don't disable 5g the phone WILL heat up a lot(the phone is continuously searching for 5g network unless it's disabled in settings)

2. Fingerprint scanner is really annoying (seriously Google? This is 2023)

3. Battery is much less if u compare it to older models. This is not a negative but it's because of the newer better performing processor. Actually if u enable battery saver it does save a lot of battery, especially on mobile data. Using the phone under wifi networks have me sufficient charge.",5

PROS

Camera : 5/5 Camera is the best. It's better than iPhones. My iPhone user friends are appreciating it's camera. However, I'm yet to test the video. I bought it because of it's Camera and looks.

Design: 5/5 Excellent design and looks. iPhones are very common these days and being owner of this unique phone brings sense of pride. People just love my phone when they see it.


CONS

Battery : 4/5 Battery backup is awesome but not that great. Lasts enough just like iPhones. Charges 60% in just an hour which is great enough for me because I never charge my phone to 100%. I don't understand why people are complaining about it.

Fingerprint: 1/5 Fingerprint doesn't work well after recent updates to Android 14. I hope Google find the fix to this issue soon.

Display : Not that great, I guess. Sometimes touch didn't work properly for me. I don't know if I got defective one.",5

Day to day tasks are very smooth,
Take very good photos. No editing like color enhance or anything is done on the attached photos.
Tried playing BGMI, performance was smooth in game almost constant 60 fps but heats up while gaming so you can't play high end games for long.

I got the update the same day I got my phone so I updated it to Android 14, and all the reviews are based on that experience

Heated when I was setting the phone up, which included transferring of app and data from my old phone to this one and during the first 2 updates.

After that i didn't face any issues with the heating in normal usage, still heats on graphic intensive tasks though, but again almost every phone heats up my old realme heats up too and even iqoo 9 Se of my brother but pixel heats up relatively quickly than iQoo 9Se, hell even iPhone 15 pro Max heats up.

Battery backup was below average on the first two days then it started to improve, Google does some ai magic in the background.

Now it can easily handle a day for medium usage. Today itself the screen on time is around 6 hour 10 minutes and it still had 21 % battery left. It has been around 24 hours since I last charged it. I guess it will give around 1.5 hours more SOT.

-such a awesome camera (though with updates it will get even better)
-design is good üíØ
-battery is 5/5 for mixed usage will give a full day backup
- performance is good ,no jitters and even 60hz feels smooth enough.
- haptics are good üëç
- charging is slow ü¶• but battery last's long so not a big issue.(2HRS WITH NORMAL CHARGER)
- 5G connectivity issues are there as of now, (and heating occurs only while using 5G and maps) 4G works just üëç awesome (these issues should be resolved with temperature going down in India after Summers and with updates too.
- the processor is capable enough to run and multi task heavy apps so no worries on the performance part.
- besides these things there is nothing to worry, everything is üòé Awesome.



Will Update after a month

- Feels like adaptive thing really works great according to the usage, satisfied.
-update like feature drop does'nt releases for every phone at a time, it's in batches.
-heatings get's controlled ig after somedays of usage
-Connectivity usage are resolved for me as of now.
-Overall, definetly google's ai thing works great.",5

Camera- 9/10 . It captures detailed photos but a dedicated zoom lens is missing so zoomed photos are not clear.

Performance - 10/10. This phone performs great in every day tasks. Multitasking and ram management is great. I don't do heavy gaming but you can play games like pubg and cod with no issues.

Battery -8/10. After tweaking some settings, I get about 6 hours of SOT every day. Battery charging is not too slow but not fast either. I get no heating issues till now.

Design - 10/10. I like it's compact design. It's very easy for one hand use. Phone don't feel too big in pocket. Build quality is also great. Plastic on the back mimic like glass and have good quality.

Display 9/10. Display colours are vibrant. Movies look good in this display. Although it struggles when you use in direct sunlight. Display is not bright enough.",5

slow charging (18watt max).

heats the top left aluminium frame. it will get warm on normal day to day tasks, it's bearable (every phone heats that much) but when you run benchmark or do software updates then it gets pretty hot like a lot.
bezels are quite huge

*Camera is fantastic
*Battery will come for one day with the screen time of 5 hrs as per my charge cycle 15 to 95
*If u charge till 0 to 100 it will come easily 6.5 to 7 hrs Max
*If you use with full brightness then ur battery drain easily 20% within a hour for sure
*Display is good
The charging time would be like 1.30hrs for 15 to 95 percent,It may take less than 2 hrs for 0 to 100.

These battery life is only on normal usage like social media, calling,videos and scrolling web pages. I have not play any games in my phone
These are my overall experience about battery

One of its highlights is its use of stock Android, which offers a clean and smooth user experience without any bloatware weighing it down. It is regularly updated and guaranteed security updates until 2028 further enhance its appeal.

The camera performance on the Pixel 7a is really good, capturing stunning images with accurate details. This makes it an excellent product for photography enthusiasts.

But there are a couple of areas where the Pixel 7a fails. I have noticed intermittent overheating issue, which can be a concern for long-term use or resource-intensive projects. Additionally, battery life leaves something to be desired, offering up to 5+ hours of screen-on time before needing to be recharged. This may require carrying a charger or power bank for extended duration of use.

In conclusion, the Pixel 7a offers an appealing combination of stock Android's simplicity, impressive camera capabilities and a really good software support. While intermittent overheating and relatively low battery life are drawbacks, they are manageable considering the phone's other strengths.",5

Earlier I was using Redme Note 8 pro so I was expecting better than it but pixel disappointed.

The only good thing is it's built quality and tear camera is average but night mode is really good.

UI is basic you won't like if u come from xiomi. Touch is average sometimes hard to clicks.
Poor battery performance make worst, After full charge (without 5g) and without much use it won't long for day.

Heating is still a BIG problem, even at 25C ambient temperature, the phone will start heating while doing the most basic stuff like scrolling through IG, video calling, YouTube/Netflix streaming or simply browsing the web. It really becomes uncomfortable to hold.

The camera is not as good as the Pixel 7, which is expected.

The front camera is very very weak in low light, too much noise reduction in video. Loss of details is evident.

Performance is fine, nothing extraordinary, there are lags and frame drops while multi tasking for swiping through heavy apps. It is irritating given the fact that same chip is used in 7 and 7pro.

The only concern is battery and charging. With a 40-watt/20-watt fast charger, it is taking 6 hours to charge fully. I don't know why Google does this but it is not recommended to use this phone as a primary phone if you travel and mostly away from home",4

Camera- 9/10 . It captures detailed photos but a dedicated zoom lens is missing so zoomed photos are not clear.

Performance - 10/10. This phone performs great in every day tasks. Multitasking and ram management is great. I don't do heavy gaming but you can play games like pubg and cod with no issues.

Battery -8/10. After tweaking some settings, I get about 6 hours of SOT every day. Battery charging is not too slow but not fast either. I get no heating issues till now.

Design - 10/10. I like it's compact design. It's very easy for one hand use. Phone don't feel too big in pocket. Build quality is also great. Plastic on the back mimic like glass and have good quality.

Display 9/10. Display colours are vibrant. Movies look good in this display. Although it struggles when you use in direct sunlight. Display is not bright enough.",5

2) Battery is OK last whole day with moderate use, but charging is slow.
3) Device heats little on calls, which is not good. But even the iPhone heats on video calls.
4) Screen/Display is awesome, tried increasing little system font. Letter and images are crisp.
5) Face recognition works only in light, which is utterly poor. So I'm just using touch ID which is just fine and secure.

It's been just one month, I'll update later. I got it in replacement with my 2.5 years old iPhone 11 128 GB. For me it's worth it as the camera and screen are far better than the iPhone 11.

A clean Android experience of course.",4

Battery: if you are heavy user probably you will need to change during the day, else will just make it till the end of the day. Also wait for the device to optimise itself in 2-3 days post first time setup.
Charging: this is a bin negative and yes the charging speed is snail pace low...it take literally 2-3 hours to get fully charged.
Overheating: does get warm up during hefty usage otherwise it's fine. Also just to draw a comparison, we are mi and realme people compared to it it's not even warm ü§£
Jokes apart yes it gets warm but upon heavy usage and if you have restricted background apps then that too will get resolved.
Performance: absolute delight all apps and tasks run butter smooth, not a gamer though but played few light games ran fine.
UI experience: flawless...90hz display is not enabled by default but once you enable it...it becomes whole different experience.
Display: display is good quality OLED, no complaints but yes little less Max brightness so direct under the sun visibility is good not great.

Finally: would recommend it as it's a great phone and ticks most of the qualities one looks for in a device. Only problem I see is the battery, if your usage is high then this is not the device for you. As battery won't last long and you will stay plugged for a very long time to add some.",5
